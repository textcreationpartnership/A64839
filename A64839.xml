            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is Enacted that all offences againſt any penal Statute, for which an Informer may lawfully ground any popular Action, Bill, Plaint, Suit or Information before Juſtices of Aſſize, <hi>Niſi prius</hi> or Gaol-delivery, Juſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> or of the Peace in their General Quarter-Seſſions, ſhall be Commenced, Sued, &amp;c. before the ſaid Juſtices, they having power to hear and determine the ſame and not elſewhere;</hi> which Negative words, as it was ſaid, take away the Iurisdiction of this <hi>Court:</hi> And whereas <hi>31 Eliz.</hi> reſtrained not the Kings Attorney, becauſe it only made mention of Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers; the Kings Attorney is expreſſely named in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and the Caſes in, <hi>2 Cro. 85.</hi> between <hi>Beane</hi> and <hi>Druge,</hi> and <hi>Moyl</hi> and <hi>Taylours Caſe, 2 Cro. 178.</hi> were quoted. And the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute would be to little purpoſe, if it did not extend to Actions of Debt, as well as Informations and Indictments. But it was ſaid on the other ſide, That it could not extend to Actions of Debt, for they could not be brought before Iuſtices of Aſſize, or the other Iuſtices named in the Act, and it ſhall only extend to ſuch Suits as an Informer might lawfully Commence before them. And it hath been reſolved, that this Act did give no new Iurisdiction, as <hi>1 Cro. 112, Farrington</hi> and <hi>Keymer's Caſe,</hi> in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation upon the Statute of 23 H. 8. cap. 4.</hi> for ſelling of Beer at an unlawful price, which gives the forfeiture to be Recovered in <hi>Courts,</hi> where no Protection or Wager of Law ſhall be allowed in any Suit grounded upon it; extends only to the <hi>Courts</hi> at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> as <hi>6 Co. in Gregory's Caſe</hi> it was reſolved. That no Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for an offence againſt this Statute could be commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iuſtices of Aſſize or Peace at the Seſſions, notwithſtanding the Act in <hi>21 Jac.</hi> which ordains, That Suits for offences againſt <hi>Penal Laws</hi> ſhall be before them and the reſt there mentioned; for the Act only extends to thoſe offences, for the which an Informer might lawfully ground any popular Action before them, and it was never held that that Act gave any new Iurisdiction. Now if this Action cannot be brought in this <hi>Court,</hi> the Statute muſt Repeal a great part of the Remedies given by <hi>5 Eliz.</hi> againſt this offence, and only leave it to be puniſhed by Indictments and Informations, which certainly was never the intent of the Statute, and would be very miſchievous; for if the Offender goes out of the Country
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51792:11"/>
after the offence committed, he cannot be puniſhed; for the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices named in the Statute cannot award <hi>Proceſs</hi> out of the County, and therefore for that reaſon there ſhould be remedy in a <hi>Court of General Juriſdiction,</hi> and ſince <hi>21 Jac.</hi> there have béen many <hi>Preſidents</hi> of like <hi>Actions;</hi> all which would be Reverſed, if that <hi>Act</hi> ſhould take away <hi>Actions of Debt</hi> in this <hi>Court.</hi> And for theſe Reaſons the Caſe being moved divers times, the <hi>Court</hi> gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff. <hi>Styl. 340.</hi>

                     <p>It was moved in <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> That the <hi>Declaration</hi> was Inſufficient, becauſe it was not declared that the firſt Action was determined; as no <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> lies upon an <hi>Indictment</hi> before Acquittal.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> inclined to diſallow this; for here the ground of the Action, is the cauſſeſs troubling of him to put in Bail: But when a man is Indicted, he lies under the ſcandal of the Crime until he is acquitted.</p>
                     <p>Another Exception was, That this <hi>Bill</hi> being in the nature of a <hi>Writ of Conſpiracy,</hi> there being <hi>One</hi> only found Guilty, the Action fails.

                     <p>It appeared alſo on the other ſide, That the Parſon had come once or twice a year, Preached and Adminiſtred Sacraments; and that without the <hi>Vicars</hi> leave, and alſo paid Firſt-fruits: Vpon all this matter the Opinion of the <hi>Court</hi> was, That the Parſon had a concurrent Cure with the <hi>Vicar,</hi> and reſembled it to the caſe where there are two Incumbents in one <hi>Church,</hi> and coming in by Admiſſion, Inſtitution and Induction, the <hi>Vicar</hi> could not diſcharge him of the cure of <hi>Souls.</hi> But <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> which are conferred by <hi>Laymen</hi> are <hi>ſinè cura.</hi>

Sed non allocatur,</hi> for it was held clearly to be all one. Otherwiſe, if it had been <hi>quod procuraverunt <hi>J.S.</hi> eum ſummonire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Second Exception was, That their proceedings were too quick; for they amoved him the ſame day wherein he was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned. <hi>Sed non allocatur,</hi> for it appearing he lived in the ſame Town, and refuſed to come to make his defence, they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately amove him.</p>
                     <p>A Third Exception was, That they had exceeded their power, which was only to amove him from his place in the <hi>Common Council,</hi> and they had amoved him from his Office. <hi>Sed non al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locatur;</hi> for 'tis that wherein his Office conſiſts, and indeed it was ſo averred in the Return.</p>
                     <p>But the main Exception was, For that they had not (as was alledged) purſued their Authority; for the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> who had been <hi>Mayors,</hi> have power given them to amove.

might be by the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> which never had been <hi>Mayors;</hi> and if in regard it was <hi>indefinite,</hi> it ſhould be intended, that all the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> were there, and it may be the <hi>Amotion</hi> was by the Vote of ſuch <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> as have not been <hi>Mayors,</hi> they being the greater number, and the others might diſſent; as if the <hi>Mayor and Court of Aldermen in London</hi> were impowered to do a thing, and this is done <hi>per Cives Londini,</hi> it cannot be good. <hi>Sed non allocatur.</hi> For</p>
                     <p>Firſt it ſhall be intended, That all the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> were there, and that they all agreed in the amoving of <hi>Braithwaite.</hi> And if the truth were, that the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> which were qualified diſſented, which muſt not be preſumed, they might bring an <hi>Action</hi> upon the Caſe for the falſe Return: And further, to enforce the intendment as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, to be <hi>per Majorem &amp; Burgenſes ſecundum Chartam:</hi> If it had been returned, that he was amoved <hi>ſecundum Chartam</hi> generally, that had not been good, for there muſt be the manner returned, That the <hi>Court</hi> may adjudge whether the Authority be purſued.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Plaintiff proved, That he had <hi>Silk</hi> and other <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> in his <hi>Warehouſe</hi> to a very great value; and that upon the Credit of them he took up divers Sums of Money, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſold them, but could not prove that they were brought in after the <hi>Debts</hi> contracted, or that he had Exported any thing at any time after, or a good while before.</p>
                     <p>To this the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their Opinions, That the ſelling of ſuch <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> if they were but the Effects of his former Trading, (for he had béen a <hi>Turkey Merchant</hi>) which he could not put off immediately upon his ceaſing to Trade, could not make him a Trader; for the <hi>Statute</hi> only extends to thoſe that Live by Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Selling. It was alſo proved, That he had a <hi>16th</hi> part in a <hi>Coalſhip,</hi> which at preſent Traded to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> but brought no preſent profit to the Owners, ſhe being much in Debt for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs. It was ſaid to be reſolved in one <hi>Craſhaws Caſe,</hi> That the having a part in a <hi>Ship</hi> did not make a man a Trader; but that was a <hi>Merchant Ship,</hi> which the Owners let out to Fraight; but the Owners Fraighted this <hi>Ship</hi> themſelves, and were to have an account of profit and loſs, and that if an Owner refuſed to Fraight he was Compellable. But in regard it could not be proved that <hi>Sir A. B.</hi> had Fraighted, or that he had received any account of profit, <hi>Keeling and Twiſden</hi> were of Opinion that it did not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51792:22"/>
make him a Trader. <hi>Rainsford and Moreton</hi> doubted. Wherefore it was offered the Plaintiffs Councel to have found it Specially; but they declined it, and the <hi>Jury</hi> found a general Verdict for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>The day after motion was made for a new <hi>Tryal, Affidavit</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, that the Foreman of the <hi>Jury</hi> was Brother in Law to one of the Creditors of <hi>Sir A.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreton and Rainsford</hi> held neither of theſe Reaſons ſufficient. For the firſt, it was their own Laches that they did not challenge upon it. For the other, they thought the breach of the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Court</hi> ought to be puniſhed, but did not think fit to ſet aſide the Verdict for it.</p>

                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> for the laſt treaſon held a new <hi>Tryal</hi> was to be granted, and that it was fit to be made an Example to other <hi>Juries:</hi> For if the Parties may give what they will, it is to be preſumed, the ability of one or other will much incline the <hi>Jury</hi> to find for him, from whom they may expect the greateſt reward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Keeling</hi> held both reaſons ſufficient for a new <hi>Tryal;</hi> which could not be, in regard the <hi>Court</hi> was divided; whereupon Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was entred for the Plaintiff; and Execution taken out, and a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> was brought, which was ſealed about an hour before <hi>Execution</hi> executed. Whereupon it was moved, That the <hi>Sheriff</hi> might bring the Money into the <hi>Court,</hi> for that the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> was a <hi>Superſedeas;</hi> for though the <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſhall not be in Contempt, if he makes <hi>Execution</hi> after the <hi>Writ,</hi> if no <hi>Superſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> be Sued out, for that he had no notice; yet the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> immediately upon the ſealing forecloſes the <hi>Court,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Execution</hi> made after is to be undone; of which Opinion was the <hi>Court,</hi> and Ordered the Money to be brought in, and not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Plaintiff.</p>

                     <p>IN a <hi>Writ of Covenant</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> declared, <hi>That the Defendant demiſed to him a Houſe, with the uſe of a Pump, and that he ſuffered it to be ſo out of Repair, that it became Uſeleſs.</hi> To this <hi>Declaration</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> demurs; and <hi>Counſel</hi> being heard on either ſide divers times, the <hi>Court</hi> delivered their Opinions ſeverally.</p>

                        <hi>Keeling, Rainsford,</hi> and <hi>Moreton</hi> held, that the <hi>Action</hi> did lye, the <hi>Uſe of the Pump</hi> being part of the things demiſed, which Words make a <hi>Covenant,</hi> as in <hi>4 Co.

decay, he conceived Covenant would lie for the Leſſee of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Rooms. And if a Parſon makes a Leaſe, and then Reſigns, he is liable to Covenant, as in <hi>12 H. 4.</hi> And the Leſſee would be at a miſchief, for he ſhould be a Treſpaſſer to Enter and Repair; and if the Leſſor <hi>ouſts</hi> the Leſſee of any of the things demiſed, 'tis clear the Covenant lies; and this is as much an <hi>ouſter</hi> as can be in this caſe, where the Leſſor is poſſeſſed himſelf. And ſo Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the Plaintiff, againſt the Opinion of <hi>Twiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who held ſtrongly to the contrary; for he ſaid he might have an <hi>Action</hi> upon the Caſe, and ſo remedy for his Damage. Alſo he held clearly, That he might Enter and Repair, as if one Licence another to lay Pipes in his Ground to convey Water, he may juſtifie an Entry to Repair the Pipes. And he cited a Caſe adjudged in <hi>9 Jac.</hi> where one by Licence erected a Cock of Hay in anothers Ground: And it was held, That the Owner of the Soil might put in his Beaſts into that Ground; but he that had the Licence, might by vertue of that Licence alſo fence in his Hay. <hi>Quando aliquid conceditur, conceditur &amp; id ſine quo res ipſa uti non poteſt;</hi> and he ſaid that he never met with a Caſe where Covenant would lie but upon an actual <hi>ouſter,</hi> either by a Stranger that hath <hi>eigne</hi> Title, or the Leſſor himſelf: And this was a <hi>non feaſans,</hi> and in that he differenced it from the Caſe of <hi>Eſtovers,</hi> being an actual <hi>Tort</hi> to ſtub the Wood up; and in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant upon an <hi>ouſter</hi> of a Term, if it be not incurred, Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be to recover the Term it ſelf, as <hi>F. N.

And he conceived, that if the Leſſor Cuts down Trées growing upon the Land Demiſed, no Covenant lies, yet the Trees are Demiſed with the reſt. <hi>Ante.</hi>

                     <p>And for the Reverſing of the <hi>Judgment, Levins</hi> Argued, That this <hi>Leaſe</hi> by the <hi>Ceſtuy que Truſt,</hi> and the Entry of his <hi>Leſſee,</hi> did not diſpoſſeſs the former <hi>Leſſee;</hi> and then the <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim</hi> could not prejudice his Intereſt, which was not put to a right: For firſt, the <hi>Ceſtuy que Truſt</hi> was at leaſt <hi>Tenant at Will.</hi> So is <hi>Littleton, Sect. 464. Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> may enter, and hold at the Will of his <hi>Feoffees;</hi> then his Leaſe can be no <hi>Diſſeiſin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Inheritance was in himſelf. 'Tis true, in ſome Caſes a man may do an Act which ſhall diveſt his own Eſtate: As if a Stranger diſſeiſes <hi>Tenant for Life</hi> to the uſe of him in the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and he aſſents, <hi>Co. Lit. 180. b.</hi> the Law ſhall not conſtrue a <hi>Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin</hi> againſt the parties Intention, <hi>Rolls 661.</hi> He that enters by colour of a void Leaſe is no <hi>Diſſeiſor, 1 Cro. 188.</hi> nor any one that enters by Conſent, <hi>15 E. 4. 5. b.</hi> Neither ſhall the Intereſt of the <hi>Leſſee</hi> be diveſted but at his Election; for this Leaſe works in point of Contract, and not ſo violently upon other mens Intereſts as Livery doth. In <hi>Latche's Rep. 75.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fiſher's Caſe,</hi> Tenant for years lets at Will, the Leſſee makes a Leaſe for years; this works no diſpoſſeſſion. If a Copyholder makes a Leaſe for years without Licence, the Entry of the Leſſee is no Diſſeiſin to the Lord, and he may chuſe whether he will take it as a Forfeiture, <hi>Rolls 830.</hi> Leaſe for years, upon Condition to be void upon <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of Rent,</hi> a demand is made, the Leſſor may make a new Leaſe of the Land, the former Leſſee being ſtill in poſſeſſion. And <hi>Blunden</hi> and <hi>Baugh's Caſe</hi> was cited in <hi>1 Cro.</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; and that a Fine doth not bar an Intereſt which is not diveſted. He quoted alſo the <hi>1 Inſt. 388. 9 Co. 106.</hi> and <hi>5 Co. Saffin's Caſe,</hi> where a <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non claim</hi> ſhall bar the Intereſt of a Term; yet it appears in <hi>2 Cro. 60.</hi> that two <hi>Judges</hi> were againſt that Iudgment given by the other three, <hi>2 Cro. 659.</hi> Tenant at Will makes a Leaſe for years, and it was held to be no Diſſeiſin <hi>volens nolens</hi> to him that had the Inheritance. And for <hi>Iſham and Morris's Caſe, 1 Cro. 74.</hi> it was the <hi>Judges</hi> Opinion upon Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and there a <hi>Fine</hi> was levied of the Inheritance, which paſſed the Truſt incluſively; but this <hi>Fine</hi> was only to eſtabliſh an Intereſt for 54 years. Then he Argued, that the <hi>Inconvenience</hi> would be very great to Purchaſers, who often keep ſuch Leaſes and Intereſts on Foot, tho' they buy the Inheritance, if they ſhould be all barred by Levying of the <hi>Fine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Solicitor è contra,</hi> He agreed that a <hi>Fine</hi> could not bar any <hi>Intereſt,</hi> which was not diveſted at the time of the <hi>Fine.</hi> He Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued firſt, That the <hi>Ceſtuy que Truſt</hi> was not <hi>Tenant at Will;</hi> for a man ſhall not be <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> againſt his own Conveyance,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51792:35"/>
unleſs by Conſtruction of Law, to avoid a <hi>Tort;</hi> as in <hi>Littleton's Caſe,</hi> where the <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> enters upon his Feoffee. But tho' the Leſſor hath a right to the poſſeſſion before the Entry of his Leſſee for years; yet when the Leſſee Enters, as 'tis found in out Caſe, he doth as much as declare, that <hi>Ceſtuy que Truſt</hi> ſhall not be Tenant at <hi>Will.</hi> Indeed the Bargainee of an Eſtate for years, is in actual poſſeſſion by force of the Statute; yet the Bargainor (in caſe of a Mortgage) may Enter to hold at Will, becauſe there was no Act done to expreſs his diſſent. He agreed alſo, that no Diſſeiſin was wrought; but there may be an Expulſion without a <hi>Diſſeiſin,</hi> as <hi>Hob. 322.</hi> where it is ſaid, If the Leſſor puts out his Leſſee for years, there is no <hi>Diſſeiſin</hi> committed; and yet the Leſſee hath loſt his Eſtate, and hath but a Right to it, and that whether he will or no: And if he were <hi>Tenant</hi> at <hi>Will,</hi> he by making this, and divers Leaſes before, hath abſolutely determined his Will; if <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> be ouſted by a Stranger, and he in Reverſion diſſeiſed he may enter again; not where he is the Wrong-doer himſelf, for that were to make him <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> againſt his Will. If <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> makes a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee enters, the <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> is the <hi>Diſſeiſor, 2 Cro. 660. 3 Cro. 830 5. E. 42.</hi> and <hi>Tenant at Will</hi> is intruſted with and hath power over the poſſeſſion. And where it was ſaid, it ſhould be in the Election of the <hi>Leſſee</hi> for <hi>100</hi> years, to take this for an <hi>Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or no, he Argued that it ought clearly to be in the Election of the <hi>Leſſor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, firſt, it was his own act, and therefore he could beſt explain <hi>quo animo hoc fecit,</hi> and that his antecedent Acts had ſufficiently done, eſpecially being <hi>Ceſtuy que Truſt,</hi> and having alſo the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in him; and he inſiſted very much upon the Notice that the Law takes of ſuch an Intereſt, tho' relievable only in Equity, <hi>7 H. 5. 3. Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> of a Mannor, to which an <hi>Advowſon</hi> was appendant, was Outlawed, the Church became void; the King brought a <hi>Quare Impedit, 2 Cro. 512.</hi> A Truſt of a <hi>Chattel,</hi> reſolved to be forfeit by <hi>Attainder, Hob. 214.</hi> in that caſe the King ſhall have the Land it ſelf, and <hi>Proceſs</hi> ſhall iſſue out of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> to ſeize the Land it ſelf, which ſhews that it hath a legal influence upon the Land; therefore, he and not the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> ought to have the Election. If <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> had made a Leaſe for years, this had been a <hi>Diſſeiſin,</hi> until <hi>1 R. 3 5 H. 7. 56. 8 H. 7. 8.</hi> A Leaſe of two Acres, <hi>habendum</hi> the one for Life, that other in Fee, to the uſe of another; ſhall not the <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> determine in which the Inheritance ſhall be: Again, It is agreed that this <hi>Fine</hi> conveys away the <hi>Truſt;</hi> ſhall the Law ſtrain to ſave the Intereſt of the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> to occaſion a <hi>Chancery</hi> Suit? And the <hi>Judges</hi> ever Expounded the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> ſtrictly, to bind the Right of Strangers, <hi>Leonard 99.</hi> It was the <hi>Chief Baron Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s

Opinion, That he that had a future Intereſt to Lands, of which a <hi>Fine</hi> was Levied, ought to have five years after his Intereſt came in <hi>eſſe,</hi> neither is there any reaſon to favour long Leaſes. By the Ancient Law, a Leaſe for above <hi>40</hi> years was void, <hi>Mirror 164, 293. 1ſt Inſt. 46.</hi> they are never without ſuſpicion of Fraud: and <hi>3 Co. Twyne's Caſe,</hi> that which is called a <hi>Truſt,</hi> is in plain Engliſh a <hi>Fraud;</hi> and as this is found, it appears by the Circumſtances to be almoſt <hi>Fraud apparent.</hi> And as to the Inconvenience which was alledged would come to <hi>Purchaſors,</hi> who deſire to keep Leaſes on foot, he Anſwered, That might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by claiming within five years; and it would be miſchievous to <hi>Purchaſors</hi> if it were otherwiſe, to have ſuch <hi>Leaſes</hi> ſet up againſt their <hi>Titles.

But it was denied; for there could be no ſuch Compoſition time out of mind, <hi>Hopps</hi> not being known in <hi>England</hi> until <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time; for then they were firſt brought out of <hi>Holland,</hi> though <hi>Beer</hi> is mentioned in a <hi>Statute</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth's</hi> time.</p>
                     <p>But it was ſaid by the <hi>Court,</hi> That perhaps the <hi>Vicaridge</hi> was Endowed time out of mind of the <hi>ſmall Tythes,</hi> of which nature <hi>Hopps</hi> were.

                     <p>Whereupon it was moved, after a <hi>Verdict</hi> for the Informer, in <hi>Arreſt of Judgment;</hi> that if either the Duty were paid, or Entry made, or the Landing were in the preſence of an Officer, it ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Act, which is in the Disjunctive, and, or ſhall not be taken Conjunctive, unleſs the words are of like nature, as <hi>1 Mar. cap. 3.

                        <note place="margin">2 Cro. 322.</note> Alſo it appoints Landing in the preſence of the Officer, that it may be obſerved whether more be Landed than is contained in the <hi>Warrant</hi> for Landing; but never meant that Entry ſhould ſuffice without payment; for ſo if Party be a Foreigner or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent, the <hi>King</hi> loſeth his Duty.</p>

It is aggravated too; in that the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> proceeded after they had allowed the <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and that they fell upon, and ſhewed their Indignation againſt thoſe perſons, who only purſued the <hi>Kings Authority;</hi> and that this was in a Caſe, which was recommended by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> to which Recommendation the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> were <hi>Privy;</hi> they had contrary advice from other <hi>Counſel</hi> then there, but they would hearken to that advice which pleaſed them beſt: <hi>Obedience</hi> is that <hi>Ligament</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> without which all will be turned into <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi> Without betraying the Truſt repoſed in us by the <hi>King,</hi> and violating of our <hi>Oaths,</hi> we cannot omit to puniſh this, therefore I agree the <hi>Fines:</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Fines,</hi> is the diſobeying of the <hi>Writs;</hi> the Reaſon of their diſproportion, is to reſemble the Meaſures the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved towards thoſe perſons whom they unduly fined.</p>

                        <hi>Keeling Chief Juſtice.</hi> It is provided by <hi>23 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> that the <hi>Laws, Acts, &amp;c.</hi> to be made by the <hi>Commiſſioners of Sewers,</hi> ſhould ſtand good and effectual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no longer than the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, except they were Engroſſed in <hi>Parchment,</hi> and certified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Seals,</hi> into the <hi>Kings Court of Chancery;</hi> and then the <hi>Kings Royal Aſſent</hi> to be had to the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this of <hi>13 Eliz.</hi> whereby it is Enacted, <hi>That their Laws, &amp;c. ſhould ſtand and continue in force, without any ſuch Certificate to be made thereof into the <hi>Chancery;</hi>
                        </hi> and then a little after in this <hi>Statute</hi> follows the Clauſe which hath been read, and that refers wholly to <hi>Certificates,</hi> or <hi>Returns</hi> to be made into the <hi>Chancery,</hi> for the purpoſe aforementioned. 'Tis plain, the Clauſe refers not to this <hi>Court,</hi> for it ſpeaks of returning their <hi>Comiſſions;</hi> now their <hi>Commiſſions</hi> were never returnable into this <hi>Court;</hi> this <hi>Court</hi> cannot be ouſted of its <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> without ſpecial words; here is the laſt <hi>Appeal,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> himſelf ſits here, and that in perſon if the pleaſes, and its <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> have ſo done; and the <hi>King</hi> ought to have an account of what is done below in inferiour <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 'Tis for the avoiding of oppreſſions and other miſchiefs.

                        </hi> Whereas it was ſaid it ſhould have been, <hi>ad comparendum &amp; defendendum,</hi> and this is <hi>ad ſequendum,</hi> which is a Form proper only for the <hi>Demandant,</hi> and ſo is the <hi>2d Cor. 641.</hi> And the Reaſon why <hi>Infants</hi> are bound by <hi>Recoveries</hi> when <hi>Guardians</hi> are aſſigned them, is, <hi>Becauſe if they ſuffer any Wrong, they have an Action againſt the Guardian, in whoſe default it was:</hi> Whereas if the <hi>Infant</hi> ſhould bring an Action in this Caſe and declare againſt <hi>Molineux, That he was admitted as Guardian, to defend for him; if Iſſue</hi> were taken upon it by this <hi>Record,</hi> the <hi>Tryal</hi> would be againſt him.</p>

                     <p>For the Admiſſion of the <hi>Guardian ad ſequend'</hi> is proper enough; for it ſignifies no more than to follow the Cauſe: And in many Caſes the <hi>Tenant</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> doth Proſecute, as in <hi>Voucher,</hi> praying <hi>Tales,</hi> carrying down <hi>Trials</hi> by <hi>Proviſo, &amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Replevin</hi> the <hi>Avowant</hi> is Actor, and in <hi>Suffering of a Recovery</hi> the <hi>Tenant</hi> is the main Agent, being to his uſe in no other be declared.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> If a Termor Deviſe firſt to one and then to another, whether he may Deviſe it over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the Limitation here after the Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, be a good Limitation over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> He may make a third Limitation, which is a Poſſibility upon a Poſſibility; at leaſt he may make <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> ſuch Limitations over. I can't certainly ſay where it will end. It can't be denied, but that a Termour may Deviſe firſt to one for life, and after to another, <hi>8 Co. 95.</hi> But I ſay he may go further, and that will appear by Reaſon and Authority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By Reaſon. The Reaſon given, why the Executory Deviſe in the firſt caſe is good, is, becauſe 'tis in Conſtruction of <hi>Law,</hi> as much as if he had Deviſed it to the laſt firſt, (if the firſt Man ſhould dye within the Term) and then had Deviſed, that the firſt ſhould hold during life; and without ſuch a tranſpoſition it cannot be good.

The Leſſee enters, afterwards the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi> enters, and Lets it to the <hi>Lord Darcy</hi> for <hi>7</hi> years, and then Lets to the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſſador</hi> for <hi>7</hi> years, which Leaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, <hi>Sir A.M.</hi> Demiſes to <hi>Freeman</hi> for a Term yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expired (this Demiſe is not found to be upon the <hi>Land.</hi>) After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Lord Marqueſs</hi> Demiſes to <hi>Germin</hi> for <hi>54</hi> years, upon Conſideration of Money, and Reſerves, a Rent, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, to Levy a <hi>Fine</hi> for the aſſurance of the <hi>Term,</hi> which was afterwards done with <hi>Proclamation. Germin</hi> enters, and five years paſſed without any Claim made; which Leaſe by mean Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came to <hi>Wicherly,</hi> the Leſſor of the Defendant, who was Plaintiff in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and there had Iudgment.</p>
                     <p>The only Queſtion upon this <hi>Special Verdict</hi> was, Whether the <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non Claim,</hi> ſhould barr the intereſt of <hi>Sir A. M.</hi> the Leſſee in Truſt.</p>
                     <p>This Caſe having béen argued thrée ſeveral times at the <hi>Bar;</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> did this <hi>Term</hi> deliver their Opinons, and did all agrée, that the Iudgment ought to be affirmed.</p>
                     <p>It was conſidered <hi>quid operatur,</hi> by the entry of the <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> and they all, except <hi>Moreton,</hi> held, that <hi>Prima facie,</hi> he was Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at Will, as <hi>Littleton Sect. 463.</hi> is, where the Feoffor enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Feoffée to his uſe; but that the Entry of <hi>Germin</hi> his Leſſée did <hi>ouft Freeman</hi> the Aſſignee of <hi>Sir A.M.</hi> which Aſſignment, though not found to be upon the <hi>Land,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cro. 660.</note> was good, as the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> held, becauſe the two former Leaſes made by the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> were expired, ſo he became Tenant at Will again; but them he making of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51792:47"/>
Leaſe, and the Leſſee entring, this muſt work an <hi>ouſter,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Fine</hi> would bar the Right: For they agreed, that a <hi>Fine</hi> regularly ſhall not work upon an Intereſt which is not dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; though in ſome Caſes it doth, as upon the Intereſt of a <hi>Term,</hi> according to <hi>Safins Caſe, 5 Co.</hi> which yet cannot be diveſted; but though the firſt Entry make but a Tenancy at Will, yet taking upon him to make Leaſes, that is enough to declare his intent to diſpoſſeſs his Leſſee in Truſt. Beſides he reſerves a Rent, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants for quiet Enjoyment, and to make further aſſurance, which could not ſtand with the Intereſt of the Leſſee in Truſt: And for the Caſes that were objected as <hi>Blunden</hi> and <hi>Baughs, 1 Cro. 220.</hi> Where it is adjudged, That the Entry of the Leſſée for years of Tenant at Will, ſhould be no diſſeiſin, <hi>nolens volens,</hi> to him that had the Freehold, for there was no intention of the Parties to make it ſo; and here the <hi>Law</hi> ſhall rather give the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him which had the Inheritance to make it a devëſting, than the Leſſee; or rather, as the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Law</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrues ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> to amount to a diveſting, or not diveſting, as is moſt agreeable to the intention of the Parties; and the right of the thing which diſtinguiſhes it alſo from the Caſe of <hi>Powſley</hi> and <hi>Blackman</hi> cited in <hi>Blunden</hi> and <hi>Baughs Caſe;</hi> where the Mortgageor held at the <hi>Will</hi> of the Motrgagee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and let for years, the Leſſee entred, and held notwithſtanding, that the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagee might Deveſt. So <hi>Sir Tho. Fiſhes Caſe, in Latches Rep.</hi> Where Tenant for years Lets at Will, and the Leſſée makes a Leaſe for years, and then the remainder is granted over; This Grant is held to be good; which, whether by the remainder there be underſtood, the intereſt of the Leſſee, or the <hi>Fee-ſimple;</hi> yet it is no more than my <hi>Lord Nottinghams Caſe,</hi> and not like the Caſe in Queſtion, For there the Leſſee held the intereſt in his own Right, and here but in Truſt; and for the Caſe in <hi>Noyes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports 23. Twiſden</hi> ſaid, he wholly rejected, that Authority; for it was but an Abridgment of Caſes by <hi>Serjeant Size,</hi> who when he was a <hi>Student</hi> borrowed <hi>Noyes Reports,</hi> and abridged them for his own uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Caſe was this; Tenant in Fée makes a Leaſe for years, then Levies a <hi>Fine</hi> before Entry of the Leſſee: It is held there, though five years paſs the Leſſée is not barred, which is directly againſt the Reſolution of <hi>Saffins Caſe;</hi> and for Authority in this Caſe, they relied upon the Caſe of <hi>Iſham and Morris, in 1 Cro. 781.</hi> Where upon Evidence it was reſolved by the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> That if the <hi>ceſty quo Truſt</hi> of a Leaſe for years, Purchaſeth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and Occupies the Land, and Levies a <hi>Fine,</hi> that this after five years ſhall bar the <hi>Term,</hi> which is not ſo ſtrong as this Caſe; becauſe there were no Leaſes made, and Entry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; and the Truſt muſt paſs incluſively by the <hi>Fine,</hi> as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51792:48"/>
in divers <hi>Books;</hi> eſpecially in this Caſe, where it is to wait upon the Inheritance, which though it ariſes but out of a <hi>Term,</hi> yet it ſhall follow the <hi>Land,</hi> and go to the <hi>Heir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the inconveniences which were objected, That if any Man purchaſed <hi>Land</hi> by <hi>Fine,</hi> that he could not keep on Foot Mortgages and Leaſes, which it is often convenient to do. The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> declared his Opinion, That in that Caſe the <hi>Fine</hi> ſhould not bar, there not being any intention of the Parties to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>And as to the other, that where the Mortgageor continuing in Poſſeſſion, Levies a <hi>Fine,</hi> this ſhould bar the Mortgagee; he denied that alſo, and grounded himſelf upon <hi>Fermours Caſe, in 3 Cro.</hi> And <hi>Twiſden</hi> agreed.</p>

                     <p>It was anſwered, That the Leaſe here was tied up by ſuch preciſe words, to begin upon the Determination of the Leaſe granted by the ſaid recited <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> that this cannot be referred to a Leaſe which varies in the Date, though agreeing in other Circumſtances; (yet the certainty of the <hi>Term</hi> is not reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neither,) And though a Leaſe is good without a Date; yet when a Leaſe is recited to be of one Date, a Leaſe which bears another Date cannot be ſaid to be the ſaid recited Leaſe. And the Caſe in <hi>Hobart</hi> is very different from this Caſe; for in the Grant of the Reverſion, the miſrecital of the particular Eſtate is not material in the caſe of a common perſon, ſo long as he hath a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in him: But here on <hi>Term</hi> is recited to give a certainty of Commencement to another; and if here be none ſuch, it muſt begin preſently; ſo that however, the Grant is good alſo here, either to paſs the Reverſion with Attornment, or being by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take effect, upon the forfeiture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the former <hi>Term, Pl. Com. 433.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſaid, <hi>Walter Chief Baron</hi> reported, this Caſe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, where one made a Leaſe to begin from the <hi>Nativity</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> laſt paſt, It was reſolved it ſhould begin preſently, and not from <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> for that was the feaſt of the <hi>Nativity;</hi> and to take it from the <hi>Nativity,</hi> the time would have béen effluxed many times over, and that in the <hi>Kings Caſe,</hi> ſuch a Leaſe would be void. But here, if the Caſe were thus, that <hi>A.</hi> had made a Leaſe to <hi>B.</hi> for <hi>30</hi> years, to Commence from the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and then <hi>A.</hi> reciting the former Leaſe to be made the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>May</hi> for <hi>30</hi> years, had made another Leaſe, to Commence from the end of <hi>B's.</hi> Leaſe; the Leaſe ſhould have Commenced after the former ended. But it cannot be ſo in the Caſe in Queſtion, Becauſe tied up to the ſaid recited <hi>Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Objection was, Becauſe this being by <hi>Indenture,</hi> the Parties ſhould be eſtopped to ſay, that there was no ſuch Leaſe; and this was much inſiſted on by <hi>Serjeant Maynard,</hi> in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>To which it was anſwered, That this being by Recital, could work no <hi>Eſtopel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the Queſtion is not now between the Parties to the Leaſe; and though they and their <hi>Aſſignees</hi> might be bound in pleading; yet being in a <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> ſhall judge according to the Truth. And ſo is <hi>Iſham</hi> and <hi>Morrice's Caſe, 1 Cro. 77.</hi> And <hi>Rawlins Caſe, 4 Rep.</hi> is between the Parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So they all reſolved, that Iudgment ſhould be affirmed.</p>

                        <hi>ERror</hi> to <hi>Reverſe</hi> a <hi>Judgment</hi> in an <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> brought by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> in the <hi>Common-Pleas;</hi> wherein he declared, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſued in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> retained <hi>Catterel</hi> for his <hi>Attorney;</hi> who in Conſideration of <hi>30 s</hi> given him, and that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a <hi>Bond</hi> with ſufficient Penalty to ſave him harmleſs, promiſed to get Bail filed for him; and Avers, that he did give him <hi>Bond</hi> with a great and ſufficient Penalty, &amp;c. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Pleads <hi>Non Aſſumpſit,</hi> and found for the Plaintiff, and he had his Iudgment.</p>
                     <p>Now it was aſſigned for <hi>Error,</hi> that he did not expreſs of what Penalty the <hi>Bond</hi> was, that it might appear to the <hi>Court</hi> to be ſufficient; as if one avow for a diſtreſs upon a Copyholder for a reaſonable Fine, the value of the Land muſt be ſet forth, and the certainty of the Fine, that the <hi>Court</hi> may judge of it. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and <hi>Gervaſes Caſe, Hob. 69, 77.</hi> In Conſideration that he ſhould give him <hi>Bond</hi> for <hi>10 l</hi> the Defendant promiſed, &amp;c. and pleads, that he offered him <hi>Bond</hi> for the ſaid ſum, &amp;c. and upon Iſſue <hi>Non Aſſumpſit,</hi> it was found for the Plaintiff. But he could not have Iudgment, becauſe the ſum wherein he offered to become bound was not expreſt, ſo that it might appear to the <hi>Court</hi> to be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jones contra.</hi> This differs from the Caſe in <hi>Hob.</hi> for there the ſum being certain for which the <hi>Bond</hi> was to be given, the <hi>Court</hi> may well judge what Penalty will ſecure it. But it is not ſo in this Caſe, for it doth not appear to what value the damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51792:57"/>
may be; ſo there is nothing, as in the other Caſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto to Proportion the Penalty of the <hi>Bond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> held, that it would not have been good upon a <hi>Demurrer;</hi> but being after a <hi>Verdict,</hi> and the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Jeofails</hi> made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (which <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſtiled an <hi>omnipotent Act,</hi>) they gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleads, That the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had another ſuch Action depending for the ſame Cauſe, and demands Iudgment of the <hi>Writ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> Replies, that that Action was commenced for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, and not for the ſame; <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that it was for the ſame Cauſe. To which the <hi>Defendant</hi> Demurs ſpecially; becauſe the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> having denied what the <hi>Defendant</hi> affirmed, ought not to have added a <hi>Traverſe,</hi> but to have concluded to the <hi>Country:</hi> As the Caſe of <hi>Harris and Phillips, 3 Cro. 755.</hi> was Adjudged, Where in an <hi>Audita Querela,</hi> to avoid the Execution of a <hi>Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſets forth, that it was defeazanced upon payment of divers Sums of Money at certain days; and that he was at the place appointed, and tendred the Money, and that the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> was not there to receive it.

                     <p>Which being ſpecially Demurred to, the <hi>Court</hi> held the <hi>Plea</hi> naught, and that there being an expreſs <hi>Affirmative</hi> and <hi>Negative,</hi> there ſhould have been no <hi>Traverſe;</hi> for ſo they may traverſe one upon another <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the <hi>Traverſe</hi> was here held good, which was allowed for putting the Matter more ſingly in Iſſue: And it appears that <hi>Phillips's Caſe</hi> was Adjudged upon another matter; For that the <hi>Plea in Bar</hi> was not entred as the <hi>Defendant's Plea,</hi> but was entred thus: <hi>Pro placito Buſh,</hi> a Stranger, <hi>dicit, Yelv. 38.</hi>

                     <p>Then it was moved, That (as the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath declared) here it appears, that the <hi>Warranty</hi> was ſubſequent to the <hi>Bargain:</hi> For it is ſaid, that he bargained for the Corn, knowing it to be the Corn of <hi>J.S. poſtea adtunc &amp; ibidem vendidit,</hi> which is repugnant. <hi>Sed non allocatur;</hi> for where it is ſaid firſt, <hi>That he bargained,</hi> that ſhall intended a Communication only, and the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it after, when the <hi>Warranty</hi> was given, which is alſo ſaid to be <hi>adtunc &amp; ibidem.</hi> So alledged well enough.</p>

                     <p>They who Argued for the <hi>Defendant</hi> made two Queſtions:</p>

And for this the Caſe between <hi>Hatton and Maſcue,</hi> which was Adjudged in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> was cited: Where in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> it was ſet forth, That <hi>A.</hi> being the Executor of <hi>B.</hi> made his Will thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Deviſe all my Perſonal Eſtate to my two Daughters and my Wife, whom I make my Executrix:</hi> And that they had Declared in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> that this made them all three <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trixes,</hi> and that the <hi>Will</hi> was proved; and that the <hi>Wife</hi> brought this <hi>Scire facias,</hi> to have Execution of a <hi>Judgment</hi> obtained by <hi>A.</hi> the <hi>Teſtator.</hi> And the <hi>Defendant</hi> Demurred, becauſe not brought in all their Names; and it was Reſolved in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> that the Action was well brought, and affirmed upon a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber:</hi> But if in the Caſe at Bar they ought to joyn, they muſt appear by <hi>Guardian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It having depended divers <hi>Terms,</hi> It was now Reſolved by <hi>Rainsford</hi> and <hi>Moreton,</hi> that the Action was well brought; and they relyed upon the Caſe in <hi>Yelverton;</hi> and they ſaid, the Caſe of <hi>Hatton and Maſcue</hi> was no Authority againſt it, for there they were named; and where ſome are of Age, no Adminiſtration <hi>durante minori aetate</hi> is to be granted.</p>
                     <p>They held alſo, that the appearance ought to be by <hi>Attorney,</hi> becauſe they joyn with others; and ſo in <hi>auter droit;</hi> and ſo is <hi>3 Cro. 377.</hi> the <hi>Counteſs of Rutland's Caſe,</hi> and <hi>541.</hi> Reſolved, that an <hi>Infant Adminiſtrator</hi> ſhall ſue by <hi>Attorney.</hi> See <hi>1 Roll. 288:</hi> and <hi>2 Cro. 420, &amp; 421.

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He might be injured by the <hi>Attorney</hi>'s Plea, and could not remedy himſelf, as he may againſt his <hi>Guardian;</hi> as if in <hi>Debt</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhould plead a <hi>Releaſe,</hi> and the <hi>Attorney</hi> confeſs it. And he cited a Caſe in this <hi>Court, Mich. 1649.</hi> between <hi>Colt and Sherwood,</hi> Where an <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> brought an Action, and it appeared by the <hi>Record,</hi> that he was above <hi>17;</hi> yet it was Ruled, he ought to ſue by <hi>Guardian.</hi> For tho' by the <hi>Civil Law</hi> he was of Age to undertake the <hi>Adminiſtration;</hi> yet the manner of his Suing was to be determined by our <hi>Law,</hi> and that could not be by <hi>Attorney</hi> until the age of <hi>21.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Caſe be cited between <hi>Peyton and Dorce,</hi> adjudged in the <hi>Court</hi> upon a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> out of the <hi>Petit Bag;</hi> where <hi>Peyton</hi> ſued as <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> and the Entry was <hi>Quod queritur,</hi> and did not expreſs, whether <hi>per Attornat', Guardianum,</hi> or how; and had <hi>Judgment;</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> was brought in this <hi>Court,</hi> and theſe Four Points were Reſolved:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> did lye out of the <hi>Petit Bag</hi> into this <hi>Court,</hi> upon an <hi>Error in Fact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Entry being General, it ſhould be taken that the appearance was <hi>in propria perſona.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> being an <hi>Infant,</hi> tho' an <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> could not ſue or appear, but by <hi>Guardian</hi> or <hi>Prochein amy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Jeofails</hi> did not aid this Caſe, which expreſſes only the <hi>Defendant's</hi> appearing by <hi>Attorney.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the other Point, He inclined that the Action brought by them all was well enough: But he acknowledged that much might be urged againſt the Caſe of <hi>Hatton and Maſcue;</hi> for the naming of them could ſignifie nothing, not being made parties to the Action. But he was not ſo much ſwayed by that Authority, becauſe he held, that the Cauſe did not come well into the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> being a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> upon which he ſaid no <hi>Writ of Error lay</hi> thither, tho' upon a <hi>Judgment,</hi> no more than upon a <hi>Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>They did joyn here, as it were, for Conformity.</hi> As if a <hi>Feme Infant</hi> be made <hi>Executrix,</hi> and Marries, the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration <hi>durante minori aetate</hi> ceaſes, tho' ſhe be under <hi>17,</hi> and ſhe and her Husband ſhall Sue.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> was abſent, being Sick; and ſo the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had <hi>Judgment</hi> by the Opinion of <hi>Rainsford</hi> and <hi>Moreton.</hi>

                     <p>It was aſſigned for <hi>Error,</hi> that the <hi>Declaration</hi> amongſt the reſt was for <hi>unum par Chirothecarum,</hi> and did not expreſs what ſort of <hi>Gloves</hi> they were, which are of much different prices, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different <hi>Leather</hi> they are made of.

                     <p>And the <hi>Court</hi> were of Opinion, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was to have <hi>Judgment;</hi> for it is an Action much of the ſame nature with an <hi>Indebitatus.</hi>

                     <p>The Plaintiff replies, That the Defendant had not paid the <hi>320 l</hi> according to the <hi>Award, &amp;c.</hi> upon which the Defendant Demurred.</p>
                     <p>And whether this <hi>Money</hi> were <hi>Attachable</hi> as a <hi>Debt</hi> due to the Teſtator, <hi>tempore mortis ſuae</hi> was the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:51792:63"/>It was argued by <hi>Winnington,</hi> That it was. For it appears by the Averment, that it was awarded to be paid meerly upon the Teſtators account, and it is but as it were a reducing the Teſtators <hi>Debt</hi> to a certainty; for an <hi>Award</hi> being no <hi>Record</hi> or <hi>Specialty</hi> will not alter the nature of the <hi>Debt;</hi> and that clearly it ſhould be <hi>Aſſets</hi> in the Executors Hands; and the Cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> was to have a liberal Conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pemberton contra.</hi> It doth not appear, That there was any <hi>Debt</hi> due to the Teſtator: There might be Covenants, or other Matter between them, which ſhall be rather intended than <hi>Debt,</hi> as ſtrongeſt againſt the Plaintiff; if there were, the nature of the <hi>Debt</hi> is altered, for an <hi>Award</hi> may be pleaded in <hi>Bar</hi> to an <hi>Action</hi> brought upon the <hi>Original Debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo this muſt have béen ſued for in the <hi>Debet</hi> and <hi>Detinet,</hi> and not in the <hi>Detinet</hi> only; ſo it is not a reducing the <hi>Debt</hi> to a certainty; as where an account is made upon <hi>Debts</hi> by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple contracts, or where an Executor gives time for payment of a <hi>Bond</hi> due to the Teſtator, this is ſtill Attachable, <hi>1 Rolls 551.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He denied it to be <hi>Aſſets.</hi> If it were, the Adminiſtrator <hi>de bonis non</hi> might ſue for it after the Executors death, which clearly he could not do; and the Executor was chargeable only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Debt</hi> extinguiſhed, and not according to the Sum <hi>Awarded,</hi> or at leaſt it could not be <hi>Aſſets</hi> before recovered; if it were <hi>Aſſets</hi> it did not follow it ſhould be Attachable, for if an Executor Recovers in Treſpaſs, for taking away the Teſtators Goods, the Damages ſhall be <hi>Aſſets;</hi> yet they are not Attacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: So Damages recovered upon <hi>Covenant</hi> made to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid it would be very inconvenient that this <hi>Money</hi> ſhould be attached, for the Executor was liable to a <hi>Devaſtavit</hi> upon this matter, and yet ſhould have no remedy for the Sum <hi>Awarded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, It would be Attachable in two reſpects, both as the Executors <hi>Debt,</hi> (for ſo clearly it is) and as the Teſtators <hi>Debt,</hi> and the <hi>Bond</hi> for performance would be Attachable for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors <hi>Debt,</hi> and the Sum <hi>Awarded</hi> for the Teſtators. He ſaid all <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> ought to be taken ſtrictly, and this was clearly out of the words, as being no <hi>Debt</hi> due to the Teſtator <hi>tempore mortis ſuae.</hi> And here it is pleaded, That it was Commanded by the <hi>Court</hi> to the <hi>Officer</hi> to Attach the Defendant by a <hi>Debt</hi> due to the Teſtator at the time of his Death, ſo no Authority to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach this <hi>Debt;</hi> and if it were by <hi>Law</hi> Attachable, the Command ought to have béen <hi>Special.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:51792:63"/>The <hi>Court</hi> were all of Opinion, That this was not Attacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the Teſtators <hi>Debt;</hi> for then the Adminiſtrator <hi>de bonis non</hi> might Sue for it. And they held it to be like the Caſes where the Executor takes <hi>Bond</hi> for a <hi>Debt</hi> due to his Teſtator, or where he ſells the Goods, the <hi>Money</hi> for which they are ſold cannot be Attached; and here the <hi>Award</hi> is made of this Sum, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of conveying to the Defendant the Goods of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, and releaſing of his <hi>Debts,</hi> which ſéems to be all one with the other Caſes.</p>
                     <p>And ſo they gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And whether this be ſuch a <hi>Taking</hi> as is put in <hi>Iſſue,</hi> they referred to the Iudgment of the <hi>Court.</hi>

                        <hi>A Prohibition</hi> was prayed to a Suit for a <hi>Penſion</hi> in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> ſurmiſing that the Lands out of which it was demanded were <hi>Monaſtery Lands,</hi> which came to the <hi>King;</hi> and that he granted the <hi>Lands, &amp;c.</hi> under which <hi>Grant</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> claims; and that he Covenanted to diſcharge the ſaid <hi>Lands</hi> of all <hi>Penſions, &amp;c.</hi> and this upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>34 H. 8. cap. 19.</hi> which appoints the Suit to be for <hi>Penſions</hi> in ſuch caſes in the <hi>Court of Augmentations,</hi> and not elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> would not grant it, until the <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of <hi>Diſcharge</hi> were produced, being a matter of <hi>Record.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But where the <hi>Surmiſe</hi> is of matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> it is ſufficient to ſuggeſt it.</p>
                     <p>And it was ſaid by the <hi>Court,</hi> That <hi>Penſions,</hi> whether by <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> or otherwiſe, might be ſued for in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court;</hi> but if by <hi>Preſcription,</hi> then there was alſo Remedy at the <hi>Common Law.

                        <hi>HIll. 22 &amp; 23 Car. 2.

                     <p>The <hi>Defendants</hi> plead, That the <hi>Teſtator</hi> was indebted in divers Sums, and <hi>ultra</hi> to pay them he had no <hi>Aſſets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> demurred; for that by this <hi>Promiſe</hi> the <hi>Defendants</hi> have made it their proper <hi>Debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it was ſaid on the other ſide, That if there were no <hi>Aſſets,</hi> there was no cauſe for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to have commenced a Suit: And to ſtay a cauſſeſs Suit can be no Conſideration;<note place="margin">1 Cro. 804.

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> Replies, That one of the <hi>Covenants</hi> was to give the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> a true Account of all ſuch Moneys as the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhould receive, &amp;c. whenſoever he ſhould be thereunto requeſted; and alledged, that <hi>30 l</hi> came to his hands, and that he requeſted him to give an account of it, which he refuſed to do.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> Rejoyns, confeſſing the Receipt of the ſaid Money, but ſaith, That before Requeſt made by the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> he laid it up in the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Warehouſe, and that certain Malefactors (to the <hi>Defendant</hi> unknown) ſtole it away, <hi>&amp; hoc paratus eſt verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care.</hi> And to this the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> Demurs generally.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Jones</hi> Argued, That the matter contained in the <hi>Rejoynder</hi> was a Departure from the <hi>Bar,</hi> for it doth not amount to an Account, but rather an Excuſe or Diſcharge of himſelf, why he ſhould not account.</p>
                     <p>Again, He ought not to have averred his <hi>Plea,</hi> but to have concluded to the <hi>Country.</hi> For the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in his <hi>Replication</hi> having alledged, <hi>That he gave no Account;</hi> and the <hi>Defendant</hi> in his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> ſetting forth, <hi>That he did give an Account,</hi> there is an Iſſue joyned; wherefore it ought to have been concluded, <hi>&amp; de hoc ponit ſe ſuper Patriam.</hi>

                     <p>For as to the firſt, the <hi>Court</hi> held it no Departure, but a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the <hi>Bar;</hi> for ſhewing that he was Robbed, is a giving an Account.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51792:69"/>They ſaid they were not upon a diſcretionary ſetting aſide of the <hi>Verdict,</hi> as when the <hi>Jury</hi> goes againſt Evidence; but whether theſe miſcarriages ſhall avoid it in point of <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They all agreed, That if the <hi>Jury</hi> eat or drank at the charge of the party for whom they find the <hi>Verdict,</hi> it diſannuls their <hi>Verdict;</hi> but here it doth not appear, that the <hi>Wine</hi> they drank was had by the order of the Plaintiff, or any Agent for him.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, in regard his <hi>Sollicitor</hi> paid for it afterwards, it doth induce a preſumption that he beſpoke it; but that again is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated, by its being put into a <hi>Bill</hi> with other things that were allowable; and if the <hi>Verdict</hi> ſhould be quaſhed for this Cauſe, it muſt be entred upon the <hi>Roll,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cro. 616.</note> that it was for drinking at the Plaintiffs charge, and it is not proved, that this <hi>Wine</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by him.</p>
                     <p>And as to the other matter, That they received a Treat from the Plaintiff after their <hi>Privy Verdict</hi> given, and before it was given up in <hi>Court,</hi> that ſhall not avoid their <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Defendant had treated them, and they had changed their <hi>Verdict,</hi> as they might have done in <hi>Court,</hi> it ſhould then have been void, <hi>Co. Lit. 227. b.</hi> It after the <hi>Jury</hi> be agréed on their <hi>Verdict,</hi> (which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid muſt be intended, ſuch an Agréement as hath the ſignature of the <hi>Court</hi> put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>(viz.) (A Privy Verdict,) They eat and drink at the charge of him for whom they do paſs it,</hi> It ſhall not avoid the <hi>Verdict,</hi> and if it ſhould, The <hi>Court</hi> ſaid moſt <hi>Verdicts</hi> given at the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> would be void; for there 'tis uſual for the <hi>Jury</hi> to receive a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation after their <hi>Privy Verdict</hi> given, from him for whom they find. But ſuch practice ought not to be, and if any of the Parties, their <hi>Attorneys</hi> or <hi>Sollicitors</hi> ſpeak any thing to the <hi>Jury,</hi> before they are agreed relating to the Cauſe, <hi>(viz.) That it is a clear Cauſe, or I hope you will find for ſuch an one,</hi> or the like, and they find accordingly, it ſhall avoid the <hi>Verdict;</hi> but if words of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, or the like paſs between them, (as was endeavoured to be proved in this Caſe) they ſhall not. Alſo if after they depart from the <hi>Bar</hi> any matter of Evidence be given them, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions or the like, tho' the <hi>Jury</hi> ſwear they never looked on them, yet that ſhall quaſh their <hi>Verdict.</hi> But they all held in this Caſe, that tho' there was great matter of Suſpition, yet there was not matter of clear proof (as there ought to be) ſufficient to diſannul this <hi>Verdict;</hi> but they ſaid it was a great Miſdemeanour in the <hi>Jury,</hi> for which they ought to be fined; and that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs <hi>Sollicitor</hi> had carried himſelf with much blame and indiſcretion; and the two <hi>Tipſtaves</hi> which attended the <hi>Jury,</hi> for that they were not more careful, but connived at theſe matters, were fined, the one <hi>40 ſhillings,</hi> (who appeared to be moſt in fault) and the other <hi>20 ſhillings.</hi>

                        <hi>A Prohibition</hi> was prayed on the behalf of a <hi>Churchwarden</hi> to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> for that they tendred him an <hi>Oath</hi> upon theſe <hi>Articles</hi> following.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly, Whether any Perſon within his Pariſh were an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, or Filthy Talker, Sower of Sedition, Faction, or Diſcord amongſt their Neighbours?</hi>

                     <p>It was ſaid to the firſt of theſe, That it concerned <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Freehold.</hi> But this was Overruled, for they may take notice of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments</hi> upon the <hi>Church yard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond, <hi>Sowing of Sedition</hi> amongſt <hi>Neighbours,</hi> is inquitable in the <hi>Leet,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops Court</hi> hath nothing to do with it.

                     <p>The matter is, whether there be any thing forfeited longer than the Life of <hi>Maine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath béen objected, That in regard <hi>Simon Maine</hi> had a power of altering the Truſts, and diſpoſing of them otherwiſe, that this ſhould amount to an implied Truſt in him of the whole <hi>Term;</hi> but that cannot be, for after his Deceaſe, the Truſt is expreſly limited to others.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, he had a power of diſpoſing, but that was to be executed at Election, and by ſuch Circumſtances as were indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually privy to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>For it was to be done by his <hi>Will,</hi> according to the firſt <hi>Proviſo.</hi> And by the ſecond, to be done by <hi>Writing</hi> under his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal;</hi> ſo not like to <hi>Englefields Caſe,</hi> in the <hi>7 Co. 1.1. b.</hi> where the power of Revocation was to be executed by the tender of a <hi>Ring,</hi> which any one might do as well as the party himſelf.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Rainsford.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak nothing to the Fraud, becauſe that is a pure matter of Fact, which is to be found by the <hi>Jury,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any Caſe be preſumed by the <hi>Court.</hi>

                     <p>I am of Opinion, that the <hi>Judgment</hi> ought to be affirmed.</p>
                     <p>The power of altering the Truſts reſerved by the firſt <hi>Proviſo,</hi> is inſeparable from the perſon of <hi>Simon Maine,</hi> for it is to be by his <hi>Will;</hi> in <hi>Moor 193.</hi> the <hi>Lord Pagetts Caſe,</hi> It is reſolved, that inſeparable Powers are not forfeited upon like words as are in this <hi>Act,</hi> and ſo the ſecond <hi>Proviſo</hi> limits to him a double Power.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Norfolks Caſe</hi> is the very ſame, unleſs for that it is there under his proper <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> and here under his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> which certainly is all one.</p>

                        <hi>Twiſden.</hi> As to the Fraud, I cannot ſee how the <hi>Jury</hi> could have found this fraudulent Settlement, made to prevent a Forfeiture enacted by Parliament <hi>20</hi> years after, which ſurely could not be without the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>I am of the ſame Opinion, as to the matter, with my two Brothers.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Simon Maine</hi> had only a Truſt in him during his own Life; and if he had brought a <hi>Bill</hi> in <hi>Equity,</hi> he could have had the <hi>Eſtate</hi> executed no further, and therefore can Forfeit no more by this <hi>Act;</hi> and it is not always, that a <hi>Man</hi> that hath power over <hi>Land</hi> hath a Truſt, as we may ſée in <hi>Cranmers Caſe, Dier 308, 309.</hi> there were as large words in the <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Attainder</hi> as here.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the <hi>Argument</hi> in <hi>Englefields Caſe, 7 Co.</hi> rules this; for if a Truſt had béen implied in the power of Revocation, they néeded to have argued, that it ſhould have been forfeited as a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> ſo the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Norfolks Caſe;</hi> for tho' the word <hi>Uſe</hi> is in that <hi>Act,</hi> and not <hi>Truſt</hi> as in this, yet it makes no difference, for an <hi>Uſe</hi> was then the ſame with what a <hi>Truſt</hi> is now; and tho' the word <hi>Power</hi> had béen in this <hi>Act,</hi> yet there ſhould have béen no Forfeiture in this caſe, becauſe the Execution of it is ſo perſonal and individual.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there found, that ever there was any Execution, and at moſt the Forfeiture could only be of what was in <hi>Simon Maine;</hi> neither can <hi>Smith</hi> Execute it by virtue of his <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> for the <hi>Kings Patent</hi> conveys nothing by implication, and ſhall never work to a double intent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale Chief Juſtice</hi> of the ſame Opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, Crooke</hi> is a good <hi>Leſſor,</hi> for the other <hi>Truſtees</hi> diſagrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes the <hi>Eſtate</hi> wholly his.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Circumſtances of Fraud, they are not material to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Truſt</hi> is wholly diſpoſed of after the Death of <hi>Simon Main,</hi> ſo that he had nothing but during his Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51792:72"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Then what is operated by the <hi>Attainder?</hi> Why the <hi>Truſt</hi> during Life is forfeited. <hi>Vid.</hi> the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Somerſet's Caſe, Hob. 214. 2 Cro. 512.</hi> But then this <hi>Truſt</hi> muſt have béen executed by the <hi>Court of Revenue.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Act</hi> doth not only give the <hi>Truſt,</hi> but the <hi>Term</hi> it ſelf to the <hi>King,</hi> that is, during the Life of <hi>Simon Maine;</hi> ſo that by this <hi>Act,</hi> ſo much of the <hi>Term</hi> is drawn out of the <hi>Truſtees,</hi> as ſerved the <hi>Truſt</hi> which <hi>S. M.</hi> had, but leaves the reſidue of the <hi>Term</hi> to ſerve the other <hi>Truſts;</hi> ſo that the poſſibility of the <hi>Term</hi> returns to the <hi>Truſtees,</hi> after the Death of <hi>S. M.</hi> and this appears by the body of the <hi>Act.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo this appears by the ſaving in the <hi>Act.</hi> The firſt ſaving, which ſaves all the <hi>Conveyances,</hi> made by the <hi>Feoffor</hi> before the <hi>29 of Sept. 1659.</hi> indeed might not help, becauſe <hi>Conveyances</hi> made to the <hi>Wives, Children,</hi> or <hi>Heirs,</hi> are therein excepted. But there the other <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſaves the <hi>Right, Intereſt, &amp;c.</hi> of all perſons whatſoever, doth in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> not derived form the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſince, <hi>25 Mar. 1646.</hi> and therein the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Wife,</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> and all are ſaved; now this <hi>Eſtate</hi> was created before, <hi>(viz.) 1643. I come now to the Proviſoes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt <hi>Proviſo</hi> determins nothing till the time of <hi>Simon Maine's</hi> Death; and conſequently this can reveſt no more to <hi>M.</hi> than he had before. For the <hi>Condition</hi> is in expectation till he have a <hi>Son</hi> living at the time of his Death; why then, by this there comes nothing to <hi>S.M.</hi> ſo much as in point of Execution during his Life: By his <hi>Will</hi> he might have limitted new <hi>Uſes,</hi> but he made none; and 'tis perſonal: No other <hi>Man</hi> can make his <hi>Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why then all ſtands as it did, and nothing is made void till the time of his Death, and then all is immediately executed to the <hi>Son,</hi> by force of the firſt <hi>Conveyance.</hi> But if the <hi>Proviſo</hi> had béen, That if <hi>S.M.</hi> had a <hi>Son,</hi> there all had reveſted in <hi>S. M.</hi> and might have béen forfeited.</p>
                     <p>The laſt <hi>Proviſo</hi> doth not create a <hi>Truſt</hi> to him, for if he had not béen <hi>Attainted,</hi> the <hi>Truſt</hi> ſhould not have gon to his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, it creates a perſonal power of fetching back the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and declaring new <hi>Truſts,</hi> obſerving the circumſtances; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame reaſon, that this <hi>Eſtate</hi> can be forfeited, a bare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor. (I mean, without a <hi>Deviſe</hi> of the reſidue) might forfeit his <hi>Eſtate;</hi> this is a <hi>Power,</hi> yea, and 'tis a <hi>manacled Power,</hi> it is a kind of <hi>Truſt</hi> that he may revoke.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Norfolks Caſe</hi> is the ſame with this: So <hi>Harding</hi> and <hi>Warners Caſe</hi> which was adjudged in <hi>C. Banco,</hi> tho' there there were two to two, and it was confeſſed by the <hi>Kings Attorney</hi> in <hi>Scaccario,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Attorney</hi> doth not uſe to confeſs <hi>Judgment</hi> in Caſes of great moment, without conſultation with the <hi>Judges.</hi> This power was not, nor could be paſſed to the <hi>King</hi> by general words of all <hi>Land, &amp;c. Conditions, &amp;c. 3 Co. 2. a. b.</hi> much leſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51792:73"/>
could it paſs from the <hi>King,</hi> (if it could paſs at all) by general words; but I reſt upon this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is a <hi>Power</hi> or kind of <hi>Truſt</hi> to revoke, but no <hi>Condition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> At leaſt, not ſuch a <hi>Condition</hi> as is given to the King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it were, it ought to have béen executed by the ſame means, as it ſhould have béen by <hi>S. M.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Englefields Caſe</hi> there was no pretence to have more than to execute the <hi>Condition;</hi> it ought here to have béen executed in the Life of <hi>S. M.</hi> and ſo it appears to be done in <hi>Englefields Caſe,</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> and <hi>Warners Caſe,</hi> for I cauſed the <hi>Caſes</hi> to be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This is like the Caſe of the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>15 R. 2. cap. 5. 1 R. 3. cap. 1. 19 H. 7. cap. 15.</hi> theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> give the ſame advantage to <hi>Lords, &amp;c.</hi> where perſons have <hi>Uſes</hi> in <hi>Lands</hi> reſpectively, as if they had the very <hi>Lands;</hi> but the <hi>Lord's, &amp;c.</hi> cannot thereby claim any greater <hi>Intereſt</hi> than the <hi>ceſtuy que Uſes</hi> had reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively in the <hi>Uſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in this Caſe, The <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Proviſo</hi> fetch back and ſave the <hi>Truſts</hi> for all but <hi>S.M.</hi> As to the Execution for the <hi>Kings Debts</hi> it differs for the <hi>Proceſs;</hi> for they ever did, and do run <hi>de terris de quibus illi aut aliquis ad eorum uſum, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true, in <hi>Sir Charles Hattons Caſe</hi> it was reſolved, That the <hi>Kings Debr</hi> ſhould be executed upon <hi>Land,</hi> wherein he had a power of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>Vid.

                     <p>So an <hi>Ejectment</hi> may be brought upon a <hi>Leaſe</hi> made in the ſame <hi>Term:</hi> So the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Limitations</hi> may be pleaded to an Action, if the time be elapſed before the Day wherein the <hi>Bail</hi> is filed, though not before the <hi>1ſt</hi> Day of the <hi>Term</hi> wherein the Action is brought: For the Action ſhall not be ſaid to be depending until the <hi>Bail</hi> is filed.

                     <p>After a <hi>General Imparlance</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> prayed <hi>Oyer</hi> of the <hi>Deed,</hi> whereby it appeared that the <hi>Defendant</hi> and one <hi>Vincent</hi> Covenanted, that he or <hi>Vincent</hi> ſhould pay the ſaid Sum.

                     </p>
                     <p>And it was agreed, that if a man concludes a <hi>Plea in Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as in <hi>Bar;</hi> if it be againſt him that pleads it, <hi>Judgment peremptory</hi> is to be given.

                     <p>But then it was ſaid, That although it were too late to urge this Matter, in <hi>Abatement;</hi> yet it appeared upon the <hi>Deed</hi> ſhewn, that the Plaintiffs <hi>Declaration</hi> was inſufficient: For it being, <hi>If the Defendant, or one <hi>Vincent</hi> ſhould pay;</hi> and the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> alledging, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had not paid, is not enough to intitle him to his Action, albeit that <hi>Vincent</hi> were no <hi>Covenantee,</hi> or had ever Sealed and Delivered.</p>
                     <p>To which it was Anſwered, and ſo Reſolved by the <hi>Court,</hi> that it appeared by the frame of the <hi>Deed,</hi> that <hi>Vincent</hi> was as well party, as the <hi>Defendant;</hi> and it is too late now to averr, that he did Seal and Deliver; ſo it ſhall be taken that he did not, and then it remains the ſole <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                     <p>And the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> cited one <hi>Cartwright's Caſe</hi> in Debt for <hi>Rent,</hi> where the <hi>Indenture</hi> of <hi>Leaſe</hi> was a <hi>Demiſe</hi> from <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and another Ioyntenant with him, reſerving a certain <hi>Rent</hi> to them both; but the other never Sealed. <hi>Cartwright</hi> brought Debt, and declared of a <hi>Demiſe</hi> of the Moiety, and <hi>Reſervation</hi> of the Moiety of the <hi>Rent.</hi> And upon <hi>Nil deber</hi> the Matter aforeſaid was Specially found: And it was moved,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Leaſe</hi> being by <hi>Indenture,</hi> whether the <hi>whole Rent</hi> were not well reſerved to <hi>Cartwright,</hi> as by <hi>Eſtoppel;</hi> or whether it were not good to him, as to a <hi>Stranger,</hi> for one Moiety? or whether it ſhould not be good to him as an intire thing, which was reſerved to him as well as the other?</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> Reſolved, that it was good only for a <hi>Moiety</hi> as he had declared: For there being an Expectation of the others Sealing, which never was done; the <hi>Deed,</hi> as to one <hi>Moiety</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the <hi>Rent</hi> reſerved, had no effect. And where one Declares againſt one upon a <hi>Deed,</hi> whereby it appears that another was bound with him, it ſhall not be intended that the

other Sealed, unleſs averred on the <hi>Defendants</hi> Side. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe where the <hi>Declaration</hi> is upon <hi>Matter of Record.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it was held by the <hi>Court,</hi> That if the <hi>Declaration</hi> were defective in this, yet it was but in <hi>Matter of Form:</hi> For he ſaith, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> did not pay, <hi>ſed adhuc injuſte detinet,</hi> which is an <hi>Averment,</hi> tho' unformal, that the Money is not yet paid neither by the one nor other.

                     <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> traverſeth, <hi>That it was the Freehold of Sir T.H.</hi> And thereupon this <hi>Special Verdict</hi> was found:</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Nicholas Heale</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee, and that <hi>16 Dec. 1640.</hi> he made a Deed to <hi>Jane Heale,</hi> Enrolled within ſix Months, by which the ſaid <hi>Nicholas</hi> did (<hi>for and in Conſideration of Natural Love, augmentation of her Portion, and preferment of her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> and other good and valuable Conſiderations) give, grant, bargain, ſell, alien, enfeoff and confirm unto the ſaid <hi>Jane Heale,</hi> and her Heirs. Then they found there was a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51792:76"/>
ſaid <hi>Jane Heale</hi> ſhould, <hi>after due Execution, &amp;c. quietly enjoy, &amp;c.</hi> and alſo a ſpecial Clauſe of <hi>Warranty.</hi> And that the <hi>Deed</hi> was Enrolled within ſix Months, and that there was no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of making the <hi>Indenture,</hi> than what was expreſſed. And if it were ſufficient to convey the Premiſſes to the ſaid <hi>Jane,</hi> they found for the <hi>Plaintiff;</hi> if not for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it was Argued by <hi>Winnington</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> He agreed that it could not take the effect as a <hi>Bargain and Sale,</hi> becauſe no Money was paid; but Argued, that the <hi>Deed</hi> ſhould enure as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> to ſtand ſeized.</p>
                     <p>It is a Ground in the Law, that the intention of the parties ought to guide the raiſing of <hi>Uſes,</hi> and the Conſtruction how they ſhall enure, <hi>Co. Lit. 49.

As if a man demiſes, grants and to Farm-lets certain Lands in Conſideration of Money, and the <hi>Deed</hi> is Enrolled; this is a good <hi>Bargain and Sale.</hi> So if a man Covenants in Conſideration of Money, to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of his Son, <hi>8 Co. 93.

                     <p>Again, the <hi>Conſideration</hi> expreſſed in this <hi>Deed,</hi> is purely appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeiſed, and a <hi>Deed</hi> ſhall enure upon the <hi>Conſideration</hi> expreſſed rather than upon one that is implied. As in <hi>Bedell's Caſe, 7 Co. 40.</hi> If the Father in <hi>Conſideration</hi> of <hi>100 l</hi> paid, <hi>Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of his Son, and the <hi>Deed</hi> is not Enrolled, nothing ſhall paſs: But where there are two <hi>Conſiderations</hi> expreſſed, there the Vſe may ariſe upon either. As if the Father, in <hi>Conſideration</hi> of Blood and <hi>100 l</hi> paid by the Son, <hi>Covenants to ſtand ſeiſed, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Deed</hi> is not Enrolled; yet the Vſe ſhall ariſe as upon a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed, Pl. Com. 305.</hi> And ſo it was Adjudged between <hi>Watſon and Dicks</hi> in the <hi>Common Pleas, 1656.</hi> The Father by <hi>Deed,</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> of Love and <hi>100 l</hi> paid by the Son, conveyed Land to him, with a <hi>Letter of Attorney</hi> in the <hi>Deed</hi> to make <hi>Livery;</hi> in that caſe the Son hath his election to take by the <hi>Enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Livery,</hi> which ſhall be firſt Executed, <hi>2 Rolls 787. pl. 25.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it hath been Objected here, that there is a <hi>Clauſe of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> in the <hi>Deed,</hi> which ſhews that the parties intended a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi> at the <hi>Common Law;</hi> for if it enure by way of <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed,</hi> the <hi>Warranty</hi> can have no effect but to <hi>Rebut.</hi> Alſo there is a <hi>Covenant, for quiet Enjoyment after Sealing and Delivery of the Deed, and due Execution of the ſame;</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:51792:76"/>
which ſhews the parties had a proſpect of Executing it by <hi>Livery, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which he Anſwered, <hi>That ſuch remote Implications as thoſe ſhall never make a Deed void againſt an expreſs Conſideration, upon the which an Uſe may ariſe.</hi> 'Tis true, if there had been a <hi>Letter of Attorney</hi> in the <hi>Deed</hi> it might have been void, unleſs <hi>Livery</hi> had followed. As if the Father by <hi>Deed</hi> grants Land to the Son, and a <hi>Letter of Attorney</hi> in it to make <hi>Livery;</hi> if none be made, nothing paſſes, <hi>Co. Lit. 49. a.</hi> The <hi>Authorities</hi> which have been cited on the other ſide are, firſt, <hi>Pitfields and Pierce's Caſe, 2 Roll. 789.</hi> where the Father by <hi>Deed Poll,</hi> in Conſideration of Blood, did give, grant, &amp;c. (as in our Caſe) to his Son <hi>Habend'</hi> after his deceaſe, and a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in it, <hi>That the Son ſhould pay a Rent during the Father's Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was Adjudged, That the <hi>Lands</hi> ſhould not paſs in that Caſe by way of <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed.</hi> But in that Caſe the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi> was repugnant to the Rules of <hi>Law,</hi> for that it was <hi>Habend'</hi> the Land after the death of the <hi>Grantor,</hi> and alſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in it ſelf. For notwithſtanding that it reſerves the <hi>Land</hi> to the Father during his Life, yet it provides for a payment of <hi>Rent</hi> to him; wherefore the <hi>Law</hi> would not help out a <hi>Deed</hi> ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory and repugnant by way of raiſing an Vſe.</p>
                     <p>The other Caſe relied upon, is between <hi>Foſter and Foſter, Hill. 13.</hi> of this King, in this <hi>Court,</hi> in <hi>Ejectment.</hi> The Caſe was; The Mother, for divers good <hi>Conſiderations</hi> and <hi>20 l</hi> paid, did by a <hi>Deed,</hi> which was Entituled, <hi>Articles of Agreement,</hi> demiſe, grant, bargain, ſell, aſſign and ſet over, to the Son and his Heirs for ever, certain Lands; the ſaid <hi>Margery</hi> the Mother quietly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Premiſſes during her Life.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> Reſolved, that it ſhould not amount to a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed;</hi> for they were but intended as <hi>Articles of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and preparatory for a further <hi>Conveyance.</hi> So the Caſe differs very much from ours, as alſo that it reſerves the Land to the Mother during her Life.</p>
                     <p>The Caſe alſo of <hi>Osborn and Bradſhaw</hi> in <hi>2 Cro. 127.</hi> hath been cited, Where the Father, in Conſideration of Love which he hears to his Son, and for Natural affection to him, bargained and ſold, gave, granted and confirmed <hi>Land</hi> to him and his Heirs; the <hi>Deed</hi> was Enrolled. It was held, the <hi>Land</hi> ſhould not paſs unleſs Money had been paid, or the Eſtate executed. This Caſe cannot be urged as any great Authority; for it appears that the Son was in poſſeſſion. Therefore the <hi>Court</hi> Adjudged, that the <hi>Deed</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Confirmation:</hi> and it being clear that way, they had not much occaſion to inſiſt upon or debate the other Point. And he relied upon <hi>Debb and Peplewell's Caſe,</hi> as an Authority in the Point, <hi>2 Rolls 78. 6.</hi> where there was a Clauſe of <hi>Warranty</hi> in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51792:77"/>
the <hi>Deed,</hi> and an Enrolment within ſix Months, as in the Caſe at Bar: But they Reſolved there, If a <hi>Letter of Attorney</hi> had been in the <hi>Deed,</hi> it ſhould not have been conſtrued a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed;</hi> and therefore he prayed <hi>Judgment</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finch, Attorney General, contra.</hi> The Lands here cannot paſs by <hi>Bargain and Sale,</hi> there being no Money paid, which I find is admitted by the other ſide; neither ſhall it amount to a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed.</hi> There are Five things neceſſary to raiſe an <hi>Uſe</hi> by way of <hi>Covenant:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, A <hi>Sufficient Conſideration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, A <hi>Deed;</hi> as in <hi>Callard and Callard's Caſe,</hi> in <hi>3 Cro.</hi> and in <hi>Popham's Reports;</hi> and hath been often Reſoved ſince.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A <hi>Seiſin in the Covenantor of the Lands at the time of the Deed:</hi> For a man cannot <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed</hi> to an Vſe of Lands, which he ſhall after purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A <hi>Clear and apparent Intent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Apt and proper Words.</hi> And the two laſt things are wanting in our Caſe.</p>
                     <p>I agree, the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is not neceſſary, ſo there be other Words ſufficient in Law, and to declare the parties Intent; for all Words will not ſerve. A man <hi>Covenanted</hi> upon good <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> that his <hi>Feoffees</hi> ſhould ſtand ſeiſed: It was Reſolved, that no <hi>Uſe</hi> ſhould aniſe upon it, <hi>1 Cro. 856.</hi> So Sir <hi>Thomas Seymor's Caſe,</hi> Where a <hi>Covenant</hi> was upon good <hi>Conſideration</hi> to levy a <hi>Fine</hi> to certain Vſes, and no <hi>Fine</hi> was after levied: It was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the <hi>Covenant</hi> did not raiſe any Vſe, <hi>Dyer 96.</hi> Therefore 'tis uſual to expreſs in ſuch Deeds of <hi>Covenant,</hi> that if the <hi>Conveyances</hi> therein contained be not executed, <hi>that then the party ſhall from henceforth ſtand ſeiſed.</hi> And where it is ſaid in <hi>Vivian's Caſe, Dyer 302.</hi> One having given, granted and releaſed to his Brother and his Heirs certain <hi>Mannors,</hi> and no <hi>Livery</hi> made, that <hi>Plowden</hi> would have averred that the <hi>Deed</hi> was made <hi>pro Fraterno amore,</hi> and ſo ſhould raiſe an <hi>Uſe.</hi> Vnder the Favour of the <hi>Court</hi> I deny that Opinion of <hi>Plowden</hi> to be Law. And in <hi>Debb and Peplewell's Caſe</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That the Land was enjoyed againſt the Releaſe.</hi> And in <hi>Moor, pl. 267.</hi> One <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted</hi> in Conſideration of Marriage, <hi>to let his Land diſcend, remain or come to his Daughter:</hi> It was Reſolved, no <hi>Uſe</hi> did ariſe thereupon.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>Conveyance</hi> there are not any Words that ſound in <hi>Covenant;</hi> the only word that looks towards an <hi>Uſe</hi> is the word <hi>Bargain and Sell.</hi> and in <hi>Ward and Lambert's Caſe,</hi> in <hi>3 Cro. 394.</hi> it is held, That if one <hi>gives,</hi> or <hi>bargains and ſells</hi> Land to his Son, it ſhall not amount to a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed,</hi> for want of apt words.</p>

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:51792:77"/>Now the other are all words of <hi>Common Law, Give, Crant, Alien, Enfeoff and Confirm.</hi> There is alſo a clauſe of <hi>Special Warranty</hi> in the <hi>Deed,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> to make further aſſurance by <hi>Fine, Recovery, &amp;c.</hi> as great a preparation at <hi>Common Law</hi> as could be.

Lit. 49. Charter</hi> of <hi>Feoffment</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> it ſhall raiſe no uſe if no <hi>Livery</hi> be made.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Dedi</hi> in this <hi>Deed,</hi> imports a <hi>General Warranty,</hi> which is not qualified by the <hi>Special Warranty</hi> after; yet if the <hi>Land</hi> paſs by way of uſe, there can be only a <hi>Rebutter,</hi> and ſo no uſe of the <hi>General Warranty.</hi> The Authorities ſince have not béen concurrent with <hi>Debb and Poplewells Caſe,</hi> but contrary to it. And I rely upon the <hi>Caſes of Pitfeild and Pierce, and Forſter and Forſter</hi> in this <hi>Court,</hi> which have been remembred on the other ſide; but no anſwered. And whereas it is ſaid, That the <hi>Habend,</hi> is after the Death of them which conveyed the <hi>Land;</hi> they are in that reſpect ſtronger than the <hi>Caſe</hi> at <hi>Bar;</hi> for by that it appears, they could not intend a <hi>Conveyance</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> which doth not allow ſuch kind of Limitations, therefore it muſt be by way of uſe, or no way: Yet it was reſolved they ſhould not paſs ſo.</p>
                     <p>It would introduce univerſal ignorance and careleſneſs, in ſuch as draw <hi>Conveyances,</hi> if the <hi>Court</hi> ſhould apply their <hi>Art</hi> to give them effect however they were penned; and it is a Rule <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia legibus, non leges Politiis adaptantur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> after heaving the Caſe twice argued, were all of Opinion, That the <hi>Land</hi> ſhould paſs by way of <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized; and <hi>Hale cited Hob. 277.</hi> who doth there commend the <hi>Judges</hi> who are curious, and almoſt ſubtil to invent reaſons and means to make <hi>Acts</hi> effectual, according to the juſt intent of the parties.</p>
                     <p>They all held clearly, That words proper for a <hi>Conveyance</hi> at <hi>Common Law</hi> would raiſe an <hi>Uſe,</hi> as <hi>Demiſe and Grant</hi> have béen adjudged to amount to a <hi>Bargain and Sale</hi> without other words; And they ſaid <hi>Pitfields and Pierces Caſe,</hi> was adjudged upon the abſurd contrivance of the <hi>Conveyance,</hi> and ſo <hi>Foſter and Foſters Caſe</hi> in this <hi>Court;</hi> and for that in that caſe the <hi>Deed</hi> was <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Agreement,</hi> preparatory to what the party intended after, and the caſe in <hi>Moor Pl. 267.</hi> where there was a <hi>Covenant</hi> in <hi>Conſideration</hi> of <hi>Marriage,</hi> to ſuffer the <hi>Land</hi> to remain, deſcend or come to the <hi>Daughter;</hi> no <hi>Uſe</hi> did ariſe there, for the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty how it was intended the <hi>Daughter</hi> ſhould take.</p>

                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51792:78"/>And they ſaid, That if they ſhould not conſtrue an <hi>Uſe</hi> to ariſe by ſuch <hi>Conveyance,</hi> as in the caſe at <hi>Bar,</hi> it would overthrow all <hi>Conveyances</hi> by <hi>Leaſe</hi> and <hi>Releaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the Objection of the <hi>Warranty</hi> in the <hi>Deed,</hi> it is well known there is ſo in moſt <hi>Conveyances</hi> to <hi>Uſes.</hi> Wherefore they gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was repugnant, for they returned, <hi>That the Lord <hi>Hawley</hi> continued in his Office until the 25 of <hi>December</hi> 21 of the King, and after that they amoved him in Auguſt 21 of the King.</hi> To which it was anſwered, <hi>That in regard upon the whole return it appears, that he was amoved, though it be ſaid he continued after, that is not material but ſurpluſage.</hi> As where a <hi>Jury</hi> gives a general <hi>Verdict,</hi> and yet diſcloſes ſpecial matter diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to it; the <hi>Court</hi> judges according to the ſpecial matter; or elſe they might mean that though he were turned out, yet he did continue exerciſing it <hi>de facto.</hi> And the <hi>Court</hi> were of Opinion, that the contradiction in the <hi>Return</hi> was not material: For <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, If it ſhall be taken that he is yet in, then there is no need of a <hi>Mandamus.</hi>

                     <p>And for the other cauſe of removal, that he was not <hi>peritus in lege;</hi> It was ſaid, That the <hi>Corporation</hi> being <hi>Laymen,</hi> could not return a thing whereof they were not <hi>Judges:</hi> That the Return was too general, <hi>nullo modus peritus;</hi> but ought to have ſet forth ſome ſpecial Fact, whereby it might appear to the <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo, They could not remove him for a Cauſe which they could not examin; he was put in by <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> authoriſed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which it was ſaid did capacitate implicitely him, at leaſt their <hi>Act</hi> ſupplied the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> which if it had been, would have diſpenſed with his diſability.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51792:79"/>
Clergy;</hi> and alſo they returned, <hi>That he abſented himſelf for nine Months;</hi> and notwithſtanding, by the Iudgment of the <hi>Court</hi> he was reſtored.</p>
                     <p>It was ſaid by <hi>Sir William Jones</hi> on the other ſide, That the abſence as it was returned, was ſufficient Cauſe to remove him; for it is returned, That without any reaſonable Cauſe <hi>ſeipſum elongavit,</hi> by the ſpace of five years, which muſt be intended five years continued, and not made up by <hi>Fractions;</hi> (and ſo held the <hi>Court</hi> in that Caſe) and <hi>executionem officij ſui totaliter neglexit:</hi> Now, tho' his <hi>Preſence</hi> be not of abſolute neceſſity to the holding of the <hi>Court,</hi> yet it is highly convenient that he ſhould be there, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Charter</hi> gives ſuch large Iurisdictions, to determine all Cauſes, (excepting ſuch as concern <hi>Freehold</hi>) according to <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> here alſo muſt judicially take notice, That the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of <hi>Recorder</hi> is concerned in other matters, beſides the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the <hi>Court;</hi> for he is as it were the <hi>Common Counſel</hi> of the <hi>Corporation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas it hath béen objected, That it is not returned, that they had held a <hi>Court</hi> during his abſence, or that any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice had enſued.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, That it muſt be intended that there were <hi>Courts,</hi> when they have returned the <hi>Charter,</hi> which empower them to hold one twice every week; and 'tis returned, That he abſented himſelf in <hi>Regiminis Civitatis detrimentum, &amp;c.</hi> and 'its apparent they muſt ſuffer prejudice by ſo long abſence. If a <hi>Park-keeper</hi> ſhould deſert his <hi>Office</hi> for five years, it would make a Forfeiture without <hi>Special Damage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other matter returned alſo, That he is <hi>nullo modo peritus in lege,</hi> is good Cauſe; for the <hi>Charter</hi> appoints them to <hi>Elect</hi> ſuch an one; ſo one that is not ſo qualified is not capable; and the <hi>Act</hi> of this <hi>King</hi> authoriſes <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> but to do what the <hi>Corporation</hi> might have done.</p>
                     <p>It is apparent, That the <hi>Office</hi> requires skill in the <hi>Law;</hi> he hath no power to make a <hi>Deputy</hi> by the <hi>Statute of 21 Jac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cauſes in many Caſes are not to be removed out of <hi>Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Courts,</hi> where they are held before an <hi>Utter Barriſter;</hi> ſo that 'tis far better for the <hi>Corporation</hi> to have ſuch an one their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſaid, The caſe of <hi>Bernardiſton</hi> differed, (beſides that he apprehended he had much of the favour of the times in it;) for he that was tried before him for having two <hi>Wives,</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before him, not as <hi>Recorder of Colcheſter,</hi> but as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner</hi> of the <hi>Gaol delivery;</hi> neither was it returned, <hi>That he was Summoned,</hi> (which was ſaid not to be material, becauſe they could not have examined the matter.) It was returned alſo, <hi>That he abſented himſelf for nine Months;</hi> but not ſet forth that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51792:80"/>
any <hi>Court</hi> was held during that time, or any occaſion for it.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid, That <hi>Cholmley Recorder of Lincoln</hi> was turned out of his place, for trying the Acceſſory before the Principal; and altho' there be no <hi>Special Fact</hi> returned here, yet it may be tried in an <hi>Action</hi> upon the <hi>Caſe.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Plaintiff replied, <hi>Proteſtando</hi> That the Defendant did not offer the <hi>Money; pro placito</hi> that he the <hi>21</hi> of <hi>Decemb. apud Derby fecit &amp; ſigillavit quandam Chartam Feoffamenti,</hi> whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Premiſſes to the Defendant, and that he came to the Premiſſes an hour before <hi>Sun-ſet,</hi> the ſame day <hi>paratus ad delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand' ſeiſinam, &amp;c. &amp; quod Deſendens nec aliquis ex parte illius ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit ad recipiend', &amp;c.</hi> to which the Defendant demurred, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged for him.</p>

                     <p>And it differs from the Caſe, where in <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant in Conſideration the Plaintiff ſhould permit him to enjoy ſuch <hi>Land</hi> for ſeven years, that he would pay him <hi>pro quolibet anno 20 s</hi> and the <hi>Action</hi> was held well brought within the ſeven years, for that it was Executory contract for every of the years, according to the intention of the Parties.</p>
                     <p>It was reſolved alſo, That the Replication was inſufficient; for that the Plaintiff having Election to make what <hi>Conveyance</hi> he pleaded, he ought to have given notice to the Defendant, that he would execute this <hi>Charter</hi> of Feoffment by <hi>Livery,</hi> for it might have béen by Enrollment.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this <hi>Reſervation</hi> being to Queen <hi>Elianor,</hi> and her Succeſſors, <hi>Queens of England,</hi> did not exclude <hi>Queen Dowagers,</hi> and extend only to <hi>Queen Conſorts.</hi> For,</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was much obſerved and relyed upon, that Queen <hi>Elianor</hi> was only <hi>Dowager</hi> at the time of the Foundation, and ſo could never be intended to exclude ſuch Queens as ſhould ſucceed her in that Capacity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> During ſuch time that there ſhould be no <hi>Queen,</hi> it was held, that the <hi>King</hi> was to conſtitute the <hi>Maſter;</hi> for he is Heir to Queen <hi>Eleanor.</hi> And whereas it was urged for the <hi>Plaintiff, That the King had not power to diſpoſe of the place, but only by way of proviſion till ſuch time as a Queen ſhould be; ſo as to commit the Care of the Poor to one, but not the Intereſt of the Maſterſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was clearly Reſolved, that the <hi>King</hi> might grant it, and that the Eſtate of the <hi>Grantee</hi> ſhould continue, tho' the King's Intereſt devolved upon the ſucceeding Queen.

                     <p>So that the <hi>Act</hi> having Conſtituted a <hi>Chancellor</hi> indefinitely over the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> and not circumſcribing his Power, it is not reaſon to exempt any part of the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> and that the <hi>County</hi> is by force of this <hi>Act.</hi> In the <hi>4 Inſt. 119.</hi> it is ſaid, that ſeeing there hath been time out of mind a <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that there ſhould be alſo in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> a <hi>Court of Equity.</hi> So the Book of the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> and <hi>Rolls Tit.

that where there is a <hi>Chancellor</hi> time out of mind, a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> follows of conſequence, <hi>4 Inſt. 212.</hi> It is ſaid, that the <hi>Chamberlain of Cheſter</hi> hath the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of a <hi>Chancellor</hi> within the <hi>County Palatine</hi> of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> as the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Dutchy of Lancaſter</hi> hath lawfully uſed and executed within the <hi>County Palatine of Lancaſter.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale Chief Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>County Palatine of Lancaſter</hi> is by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and therefore <hi>Outlawry</hi> there is a good <hi>Plea</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability; but an <hi>Outlawry</hi> in <hi>Cheſter</hi> is not pleadable here, for that is a <hi>County Palatine</hi> by Preſcription.</p>
                     <p>The Poſſeſſions of the <hi>Duke of Lancaſter</hi> were not made a <hi>Ducatus,</hi> until <hi>2 H. 5.</hi> in the <hi>Parliament Roll,</hi> for that year 'tis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Quod ſigilla pro Ducatu Lancaſtriae allocentur,</hi> and that it ſhould be governed <hi>per Miniſtros Ducatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the <hi>Parliament Roll, 39 H. 6.</hi> amongſt the <hi>Tower Records</hi> it appears; that there was appointed a <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> an <hi>Attorney, Auditor,</hi> a <hi>Steward,</hi> and a <hi>General Receiver;</hi> alſo a <hi>Chancellor</hi> and the like <hi>Officers</hi> for the <hi>County Palatine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that before the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>1 Ed. 4.</hi> there was a <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Dutchy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not think the hare granting of a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> will incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a <hi>Court of Equity,</hi> nor is ſuch a <hi>Court</hi> incident to a <hi>County Palatine,</hi> tho' there is a general grant of <hi>Jura regalia;</hi> but the main matter is upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>1 Ed. 4.</hi> which Enacts, That the <hi>County of Lancaſter</hi> be a <hi>County Palatine,</hi> (which perhaps would have otherwiſe determined by the <hi>Attainder</hi>) and that it be parcel of the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> and that there be <hi>Officers and Councellors for the guiding of the ſame Dutchy, and of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Officers, Miniſters and Tenants, and Inhabitants thereof, in as great, ample and large Form, as <hi>Henry</hi> calling himſelf King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5, at any time herein had uſed and enjoyed lawfully; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That in the ſame Dutchy be uſed, had and occupied all ſuch Freedoms, Liberties, Franchiſes, Priviledges, Cuſtoms and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions as were uſed therein lawfully.</hi> Theſe words would not of themſelves give a <hi>Court of Equity,</hi> but are relative to what was formerly; and the Preſidents that have been produced, are an Evidence that there was ſuch a <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> exerciſed before this <hi>Act,</hi> which is confirmed and eſtabliſhed by it.</p>
                     <p>We have no full account of its original, but there are ſuch Prints and Footſteps of it, that we muſt preſume it lawful; or otherwiſe, 'tis not to be thought that the <hi>Act</hi> ſhould refer to it, <hi>Holts Caſe</hi> agrees, that they have a <hi>Court of Equity,</hi> and ſo as 'tis reported in <hi>Rolls,</hi> tho' there is a miſtake in the Report, where 'tis ſaid, that the <hi>Dutchy</hi> have no Iuriſdiction of ſuch <hi>Lands</hi> as lye out of the <hi>County Palatine,</hi> tho' holden of the <hi>King;</hi> but poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they may extend their Iuriſdiction too far, when they retain

                     <p>I think no <hi>Prohibition</hi> ought to go in this Caſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that the <hi>Statute</hi> refers to the Iuriſdiction for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly exerciſed, and appoints the <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> to be under the ſame <hi>Regulation.</hi> And for that, there are ſuch multitude of Preſidents of Proceedings in this nature, (and allowing tranſmiſſion of Cauſes yields them a Iurisdiction) for the ſpace of <hi>200</hi> years, and ſo many <hi>Mens Eſtates</hi> depend upon their <hi>Decrees,</hi> which have been made with the aſſiſtance of ſo many Learned Iudges, which at all times have béen called to aſſiſt in this <hi>Court,</hi> that it would be very unreaſonable and inconvenient to unſettle them.</p>
                     <p>Vpon a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> the matter might be more ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, than it is fit to do upon a <hi>Prohibition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Twiſden and Rainsford</hi> concurred, That no <hi>Prohibition</hi> ought to go.</p>
                     <p>It was then objected, That this <hi>Bill</hi> was not well exhibited, for it was directed <hi>Cancellario</hi> only; whereas the <hi>Court</hi> is holden <hi>coram Cancellario &amp; Concilio.</hi>

                        <hi>JOhn Maddy</hi> was indicted, for that he <hi>ex malitia ſua praecogitat' felonice murdravit Franc' Mavers,</hi> upon which he was arraigned at the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and pleaded <hi>Not guilty;</hi> and the <hi>Jury</hi> found a <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> by the direction of <hi>Juſtice Twiſden</hi> then <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Aſſize</hi> there, which was to this effect.</p>

                     <p>To this the Defendant pleaded <hi>Non Aſſumpſit,</hi> and a <hi>Verdict</hi> was found for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>It was moved in <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> for that at the time of the Promiſe there doth not appear, that there was any cauſe of Suit agaiſt the <hi>Heir;</hi> for 'tis not ſet forth, that the Anceſter did bind his <hi>Heirs,</hi> and the Conſideration is not here to forbear to Sue generally, but to ſtay a Suit againſt the Defendant, whom he could not Sue.</p>

                     <p>It was twice argued at the <hi>Bar,</hi> and was now ſet down for the Reſolution of the <hi>Court,</hi> which <hi>Hale</hi> delivered with the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſaid they were all of Opinion for the Plaintiff. For what intereſt a <hi>Man</hi> hath, he hath it in a double capacity, either as a <hi>Chattel,</hi> and ſo tranſmiſſible to the <hi>Executors and Adminiſtrators,</hi> or as an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and ſo in capacity of tranſmitting it to his <hi>Heir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then if <hi>Tenant</hi> in <hi>Fee</hi> makes a <hi>Leaſe,</hi> and reſerves the <hi>Rent</hi> to him and his <hi>Executors,</hi> the <hi>Rent</hi> cannot go to them, for there is no <hi>Teſtamentary Eſtate.</hi> On the other ſide, if <hi>Leſſee</hi> for a <hi>100</hi> years ſhould make a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for <hi>40</hi> years, reſerving <hi>Rent</hi> to him and his <hi>Heirs,</hi> that would be void to the <hi>Heir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now a Reſervation is but a Return of ſomewhat back in Retribution of what paſſes; and therefore muſt be carried over to the Party which ſhould have ſucceeded in the <hi>Eſtate</hi> if no <hi>Leaſe</hi> had béen made, and that has béen always held, where the Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is general.</p>
                     <p>So, tho' it doth not properly create a <hi>Fee,</hi> yet 'tis a deſcendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Eſtate;</hi> becauſe it comes in lieu of what would have deſcended; therefore Conſtructions of Reſervations have been ever according to the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of the thing.</p>
                     <p>If two <hi>Joynt-teants</hi> make a <hi>Leaſe,</hi> and reſerve the <hi>Rent</hi> to one of them, this is a good to both, unleſs the <hi>Leaſe</hi> be by <hi>Indenture;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Eſtoppel,</hi> which is not in our Caſe, for the <hi>Executors</hi> are <hi>Strangers</hi> to the <hi>Deed.</hi>

                     <p>If a <hi>Man</hi> reſerves a <hi>Rent</hi> to him or his <hi>Heirs,</hi> 'tis void to the <hi>Heir, 1 Inſt. 214. a.</hi> But in <hi>Mallorys Caſe, 5 Co.</hi> where an <hi>Abbot</hi> reſerved a <hi>Rent during the Term</hi> to him or his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> it was reſolved good to the <hi>Succeſſor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Brudnels Caſe, 5 Co.</hi> that if a <hi>Leaſe</hi> be made for years, if <hi>A. and B.</hi> ſo long live, if one of them dies the <hi>Leaſe</hi> Determines, becauſe not ſaid, if either of them ſo long lives.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> They held the <hi>Preſcription</hi> to be good, (and being laid as a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in the <hi>Mannor,</hi> it was not needful to expreſs the <hi>Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Eſtates</hi>) it doth not take away all the profit of the <hi>Land</hi> from the <hi>Lord;</hi> for his intereſt in the <hi>Trees, Mines, Buſhes, &amp;c.</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. <hi>Co.

                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> were agreed in this point, in the Caſe between <hi>Porter and North,</hi> brought here about three years ſince; the principal doubt in that Caſe was, whether the <hi>Freeholders and Copyholders</hi> could in pleading alledge a <hi>Joint Preſcription</hi> for the <hi>Sole Paſture;</hi> and for the miſchief alledged, that this might be obtained from every <hi>Lord,</hi> that had not of a great many years uſed his <hi>Common,

Hale</hi> ſaid, It would not be ſufficient to prove an Vſage for the <hi>ſole Paſture,</hi> to ſhew that the <hi>Tenants</hi> had only fed it; unleſs it were proved alſo, that the <hi>Lord</hi> had been oppoſed in putting in his <hi>Cattle,</hi> and the <hi>Cattle</hi> Impounded from time to time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the Second Objection:</hi> They held that <hi>Levancy</hi> was not material in this caſe, becauſe the ſole <hi>Feeding</hi> is claimed. So where <hi>Common</hi> for a certain number of Beaſts is claimed, 'tis poſſible between the <hi>Tenants</hi> there may be ſome proportioning of it, that one may not eat up all from the reſt; but 'tis not material to the <hi>Owner</hi> of the Soyl. And <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſaid, it was Reſolved in this <hi>Court,</hi> between <hi>Stonell and Maſſelden,</hi> that want of averment of <hi>Levancy</hi> and <hi>Couchancy</hi> was aided by a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</hi>

that the Tenants of the Mannor might Grind at them; and that Time out of mind the Tenants had Ground <hi>omne frumentum,</hi> to be ſpent in their Houſes, at the Mills of <hi>J. C.</hi> or at the Mills of <hi>J. H.</hi>

                        </hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>the ſame Oath in ſubſtance.</hi> So the Act of <hi>1 Eliz. cap. 1.</hi> is, <hi>That the Oath ſhall be taken according to the Tenour and Effect hereafter following.</hi> Therefore it was Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the <hi>Indictment</hi> might have been upon the Act of <hi>7 Jac.</hi> but not upon <hi>3 Jac.</hi> which it was conceived was tyed up to the Perſon of <hi>King James,</hi> and therefore determined by his Death. As if a <hi>Leaſe</hi> be made <hi>durante bene placito Regis nunc,</hi> it doth end by the <hi>Dimiſe</hi> of that King that made it: Otherwiſe, if it be <hi>durante bene placito Regis, Moor pl. 311.</hi> And though theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> for the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> be General Laws, and need not have been recited; yet when an <hi>Indictment</hi> is grounded upon an <hi>Act</hi> therein mentioned, which will not maintain it, it ſhall not be made good upon any other General Act.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Matter inſiſted upon for <hi>Error,</hi> was in the Entry of the <hi>Nihil dicit,</hi> which was, <hi>Ideo remanſit Dom' Rex verſus eundem indefenſus,</hi> whereas it ought to have been <hi>remanet,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Record</hi> it ſelf muſt expreſs: But as it is, 'tis but an <hi>Hiſtory of the Record,</hi> and therefore upon <hi>Indictments</hi> where the <hi>Award</hi> of the <hi>Venire</hi> is <hi>Praeceptum fuit,</hi> 'tis not good, but ſhould he <hi>Praeceptum eſt.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Exception was taken to the <hi>Venire,</hi> which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Sheriff</hi> to Return <hi>12 probos &amp; legales homines, qui nec Dom' Regem nec aliquam partem aliqua affinitate attingunt;</hi> whereas in the <hi>King's Caſes</hi> his <hi>Kindred</hi> may be Returned, and therein no Challenge to the Favour, neither ought the <hi>Sheriff</hi> to be reſtrained from Returning them.</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It was alledged, that the <hi>Statute</hi> was miſ-recited in two places:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It was alſo Objected, That the words of the <hi>Act</hi> being, <hi>That ſuch as refuſe the Oath ſhall incur the danger and penalty of <hi>Praemunire</hi> mentioned in the Statute of 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2.</hi> which Enacts, <hi>That Proceſs ſhall be made againſt the Offenders therein mentioned by <hi>Praemunire facias,</hi> in manner as 'tis Ordained in other Statutes.</hi> And it appears that no ſuch <hi>Proceſs</hi> was made upon this <hi>Indictment;</hi> wherefore the <hi>Statute</hi> is not obſerved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Curia.</hi> The firſt <hi>Error</hi> was diſallowed by all the <hi>Court,</hi> and held clearly, that the <hi>Judgment</hi> was well grounded upon the <hi>Statute of 3 Jac.</hi> For the naming of the <hi>King</hi> is but an inſtance of the thing as it ſtands at preſent; and it might as well be objected, that the <hi>Oath</hi> in the <hi>Statute</hi> is, <hi>I A.B. do ſwear, &amp;c.</hi> And tho' ſome <hi>Statutes</hi> ſay according to the <hi>Tenour and Effect,</hi> and this is <hi>the Oath hereafter following;</hi> it was held to be all one, for according to the <hi>Tenour and Effect,</hi> and according to the words are all one, as where a <hi>Certiorari</hi> is to certifie <hi>Tenorem Recordi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond was held to be <hi>Error,</hi> and that the Iudgment given upon the <hi>nihil dicit</hi> muſt be reverſed, (for there were ſeveral Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given) <hi>(viz.) One upon that, and another given againſt the reſt, which therefore was not affected by the Error.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:51792:93"/>The fourth was overruled; for where the Party is preſent, the Iudgment is always <hi>quod committitur,</hi> as appeared by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the Variances from the <hi>Statute</hi> were not held to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; for in <hi>Old writings</hi> 'tis written <hi>Sea of Rome;</hi> and declaring in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and in my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> are the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth <hi>Error</hi> was alſo diſallowed, for the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> are, <hi>ſhall incur the danger and penalty of <hi>Praemunire</hi> mentioned in 16 R. 2.</hi> which doth not neceſſarily bind up to the <hi>Proceſs;</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But as to the third <hi>Exception</hi> which was taken to the <hi>Venire,</hi> they ſaid they would be adviſed until the next <hi>Term;</hi> and they told the <hi>Priſoners</hi> (who were <hi>Quakers,</hi> and had brought a <hi>Paper</hi> which they ſaid contained their acknowledgment of the <hi>Kings</hi> Authority, and Profeſſion to ſubmit to his <hi>Government;</hi> and that they had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the matter contained in the <hi>Oath,</hi> but to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only, and that they durſt not take an <hi>Oath</hi> in any Cauſe which they prayed might be read, but it could not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that their beſt courſe were to ſupplicate his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in the mean time for his Gracious Pardon.</p>

                        <hi>Hale.

                     <p>HE was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Orphans,</hi> and upon an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> it was returned, <hi>That the City of <hi>London</hi> is an ancient City, and that time out of mind the Mayor and Aldermen have had the cuſtody of Orphans within the City, until the Age of 21 or Marriage, and that there hath been time out of mind a Court of Record, (called the Court of Orphans) holden before them, having Conuſance of all matters concerning Orphans, and that they had power to give Licence to Marry a Woman which was their Orphan, or to deny it upon reaſonable cauſe; and if any one did Marry ſuch Orphan without Licence firſt had from the ſaid Court, that they might impoſe a reaſonable Fine upon him, and if he ſhould refuſe to pay it, or to give Security, to commit him to Priſon.</hi> It was alſo returned, <hi>That <hi>Harwood</hi> did Marry ſuch an Orphan without Licence firſt obtained, whereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent in Court they fined him 40 l and he refuſing to pay it, or give Security was committed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this return <hi>Firſt</hi> it was objected, That this <hi>Cuſtom</hi> ſhall not bind <hi>Strangers,</hi> in <hi>1 Cro. 689.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Cuſtom</hi> as returned is unreaſonable, for it would oblige <hi>Strangers</hi> at what diſtance ſoever from <hi>London,</hi> who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51792:96"/>
cannot take notice who are <hi>Orphans</hi> of the <hi>City;</hi> yet they ſhould incur a penalty by Marrying them without leave from the <hi>City,</hi> and they have not returned, that <hi>Harwood</hi> Married the <hi>Orphan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>City;</hi> and therefore it muſt be intended that he did not, and in all other Points moſt advantagiouſly for him, in regard he cannot ſhew the truth of his Caſe by pleading to the Return.

The Defendant pleaded, that he found him vagrant in another <hi>County,</hi> and there retained him, and held that it was a good plea, for he was not bound to take notice of a <hi>retenier</hi> by the Plaintiff, when it was in another <hi>County, 17 E. 4. 7. b.</hi> The difference is taken between Cuſtoms, general ſuch as <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> and private particular Cuſtoms, the one everyone ſhall take notice of, but not the other, <hi>3 Cro.

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is unreaſonable, that they ſhould impoſe the <hi>Fine</hi> who are to have it, and ſo to be Iudges and Parties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It was alledged, That the <hi>Fine</hi> was unreaſonable, which is not to be proportioned to the Portion the <hi>Orphan</hi> is to have, (which was ſhewn in the Return to be <hi>800 l</hi>) but to the crime, for it doth not appear, that the <hi>City</hi> is to have the value of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> or any benefit by it; and in this Caſe there was no diſparagement, for his quality deſerved ſuch a Portion, and he had the conſent of her <hi>Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding theſe Exceptions, to the Return it was reſolved by all the <hi>Court,</hi> that he ſhould be remanded.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>1,</hi> that it is not returned, <hi>Harwood</hi> is a <hi>Freeman,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> reſolved, that it is not material, for in many Caſes <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> are bound by the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as that of <hi>Foreign</hi> bought and <hi>Foreign</hi> ſold, was reſolved to be a good <hi>Cuſtom, 15 Car. 2.</hi> between <hi>Hutchins</hi> and <hi>Players</hi> in <hi>Communi Banco.</hi>

                        <hi>2.</hi> Tho' it appears the <hi>Marriage</hi> was in a <hi>Foreign County,</hi> and not ſhewn that he had Notice; it is all one, for if that might be an excuſe, the Government of <hi>Orphans</hi> by the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> would be utterly inſignificant, for it would be only to ſeduce the <hi>Orphan</hi> out of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> and whatever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice there were to diſparage her in a <hi>Marriage,</hi> it would be diſpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by them; and Notice in this caſe is impoſſible to be given, but moſt eaſie to be taken, for what more proper, than for a <hi>Man</hi> to inform himſelf of the Condition of her, whom he intends to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51792:97"/>
make his <hi>Wife?</hi> and if Notice were requiſite, it muſt be given to all the <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>England</hi> capeable of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould that be, by fixing it like a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place in the <hi>County?</hi> Yet it would be then hard to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a <hi>Man</hi> was bound to take notice of ſuch a thing; the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of this <hi>King,</hi> that takes away the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Wards,</hi> ſaves and confirms the Iurisdiction of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Orphans</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which being in a general Law is within every mans Notice; for the Caſe of taking away a <hi>Mans Servant</hi> in a <hi>Foreign County</hi> to that he was retained in, is not like to this, for it he be detained after demand made, he which firſt retained him may have an <hi>Action,</hi> and ſo is at no loſs; but here there is no remedy by undoing the <hi>Marriage,</hi> and therefore 'tis fit the raſhneſs of it ſhould be puniſhed. This <hi>Cuſtom</hi> concerning <hi>Orphans,</hi> is not confined to the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>London</hi> in many particulars. All the <hi>Children</hi> of a <hi>Freeman</hi> tho' he dies, and they were born out of <hi>London,</hi> ſhall yet be <hi>Orphans;</hi> If a <hi>Legacy</hi> be bequeathed to a <hi>City Orphan</hi> in any <hi>Foreign County,</hi> the <hi>Executor, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be compelled to give Security to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Orphans</hi> for the payment of it. <hi>Et vid. Luch's Caſe,</hi> in <hi>Hob. 247.</hi> The intereſt of the <hi>City</hi> adheres to the perſon of the <hi>Orphan</hi> where ever he is; as a <hi>Citizen</hi> of <hi>London</hi> ſhall have his perſonal Priviledges in all places, as exemption from <hi>Toll, Priſage,</hi> (<hi>Quaere</hi> the laſt) <hi>(per Hale)</hi> And as well as they may have a Raviſhment <hi>de gard,</hi> in what <hi>County</hi> ſoever the <hi>Orphan</hi> was taken, ſo they may puniſh an unlicenſed <hi>Marriage. Wallers Caſe, 22 Jac.</hi> was the ſame with this which was reſolved for the <hi>City.</hi> It appears by the Return that <hi>Harwood</hi> was preſent in <hi>Court;</hi> and <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, they could not award <hi>Proceſs</hi> into a <hi>Foreign County.</hi>

Horſe and killed him;</hi> and that divers offered to prove this before the <hi>Coroner,</hi> and he would not hear them: And if this <hi>Enqueſt</hi> ſhould ſtand, the King would loſe his <hi>Deodand;</hi> and alledged, that there were ſeveral Preſidents of this Nature, as in one <hi>Michael Bartholomew's Caſe,</hi> and <hi>Toom's Caſe,</hi> who Hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at <hi>Hackney</hi> about <hi>15</hi> years ſince.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> ſaid in thoſe Caſes it was proved, that there was Practice with the <hi>Coroner</hi> to ſuppreſs the <hi>King's Evidence,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> was ſet aſide upon a <hi>Malê ſe geſſit.</hi> If a <hi>Coroner</hi> omits to enquire, this <hi>Court</hi> as <hi>Supream Coroner</hi> throughout <hi>England,</hi> may Enquire, or may make <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> to Enquire, or <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> may Enquire; but then it is not <hi>Super viſum corporis,</hi> and therefore may be Traverſed.

                     <p>Another Matter was moved, That the <hi>Indictment</hi> alledged the <hi>Perjury</hi> to be committed in Middleſex; whereas it appeared by the <hi>Affidavit</hi> produced, that it was taken at <hi>Juſtice Twiſden's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in the <hi>Inner Temple;</hi> wherefore it ought to have been tryed in <hi>London,</hi> where the <hi>Oath</hi> was taken; and tho' the <hi>Affidavit</hi> were Filed in <hi>Court,</hi> that would not help it.

                     <p>But it was Reſolved by all the <hi>Court,</hi> that this <hi>Livery</hi> was well Executed after the <hi>Marriage:</hi> For an <hi>Intereſt</hi> paſſeth by the <hi>Livery in View,</hi> which cannot be countermanded.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Plaintiff demurred; So the ſole <hi>queſtion</hi> was, whether a <hi>Smiths Forge</hi> were within the <hi>Acts;</hi> it being once argued the laſt <hi>Term,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> now gave their Opinion.</p>

                        <hi>Moreton.</hi> I think a <hi>Smiths Forge</hi> ought to pay; 'tis a great part of the <hi>Kings Revenue,</hi> almoſt in every <hi>Village</hi> there is one, we ſhould explain the <hi>Act</hi> liberally for the <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rainsford</hi> of the ſame Opinion; 'tis within the words <hi>(ſcilicet,) an Hearth whereon Fire is uſed,</hi> and within the meaning, for there is an exception of things not ſo properly <hi>Fire hearths</hi> as this, <hi>(viz.) Private Ovens.</hi> Where the <hi>Act</hi> excepts <hi>Blowing Houſes,</hi> I take it is meant <hi>Glaſs houſes,</hi> and the <hi>Houſes</hi> at <hi>Ironworks;</hi> by <hi>Stamps</hi> I think is meant <hi>Preſſes, Calenders</hi> for <hi>Cloaths;</hi> by the very words, <hi>Houſes</hi> that are not <hi>Dwelling Houſes</hi> are charged. The objection that it is his <hi>Trade,</hi> is anſwered by the inſtance of <hi>Cooks, Chandlers, Common Ovens, Hearths of Tripewomen,</hi> who boil <hi>Neats Feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> of the ſame Opinion, the words are general, yet I would not extend it to every <hi>Hearth</hi> that has a <hi>Fire</hi> upon it, as <hi>Stils and Alembicks,</hi> for ſo we might extend it to a <hi>Chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing diſh of Coals;</hi> but we muſt take it for a Rule, to extend it to thoſe things which are moſt general. A <hi>Smiths Forge</hi> is of ſuch uſe, that 'tis found almoſt in every <hi>Village;</hi> therefore 'twas rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned a great piece of hardſhip and ſlavery upon the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they were not permitted a thing ſo uſeful amongſt them. The exceptions enumerate particulars, therefore it excludes whatever is not expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale.</hi> I would fain know how the fact is. Do <hi>Silver Smiths, &amp;c.</hi> pay? It were too narrow to extend it only to <hi>Common Chimneys,</hi> and too great a latitude to extend it to every place where <hi>Fire</hi> is, where a <hi>Man</hi> can but warm his <hi>Hands.</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>Boylers</hi> in <hi>Cooks Chimneys,</hi> and the <hi>Fireplaces</hi> of <hi>Worſtead Combers</hi> do not pay, <hi>Common Ovens</hi> ſhould have paid, tho' there were no exception of <hi>Private Ovens,</hi> for they never are, or can be without a <hi>Chimney.</hi> This is matter of fact, I have not enquired into, and I would be loath to deliver an Opinion without much inquiry; but 'tis very probable that they are <hi>Firehearths,</hi> and not excepted; but it appears plainly upon the <hi>Record,</hi> that 'tis a <hi>Firehearth,</hi> and by the general Demurrer 'tis admitted.</p>
                     <p>(<hi>Note,</hi> There was a <hi>Special Rule,</hi> that no advantage ſhould be taken of the Pleading by either ſide.) But <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, he did not know how they were bound by that <hi>Rule.</hi>

                     <p>Afterwards in <hi>23 Car. 1.</hi> he in conſideration of <hi>6000 l</hi> (proved to be paid) Grants out of the ſaid <hi>Lands</hi> a <hi>Rent</hi> of <hi>400 l per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> to <hi>Sir Ralph Bovy</hi> and his <hi>Heirs,</hi> with power to enter into the <hi>Land,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Rent</hi> was not paid, and to retain it until ſatisfaction.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when <hi>Sir W.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this <hi>Settlement</hi> being in purſuance of <hi>Articles</hi> made precedent to the <hi>Marriage,</hi> had not the leaſt colour of fraud, whereby a <hi>Purchaſer</hi> might avoid it; and if there had been but a Verbal Agreement for ſuch a <hi>Settlement,</hi> it would have ſerved the turn. And the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid, if there had been no precedent Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that it had been a voluntary <hi>Conveyance,</hi> tho' every ſuch an one carries an Evidence of fraud; yet is not upon that account, only always to be reckoned fraudulent, or to be avoided by a <hi>Purchaſer</hi> upon a valuable Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas it was objected, That the <hi>Truſt</hi> of the <hi>Term</hi> which was but a <hi>Chattel</hi> could not be Entailed, and therefore the <hi>Term</hi> was liable to the <hi>Rent</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>Aſſignment</hi> of it, and limiting the <hi>Truſt</hi> as before.</p>
                     <p>It was anſwered, and reſolved by the <hi>Court;</hi> that if it had béen a <hi>Term</hi> in <hi>Groſs</hi> in <hi>F. D.</hi> the <hi>Truſt</hi> of it could have been no more Entailed than the <hi>Term</hi> it ſelf, but <hi>F. D.</hi> having the <hi>Term</hi> in Point of Intereſt, and at the ſame, the <hi>Truſt</hi> of the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> might Entail the <hi>Truſt</hi> of the <hi>Term,</hi> to wait upon the <hi>Inheritance;</hi>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:51792:104"/>
and that the <hi>Chancery</hi> does every day allow, which they ſhould take notice of.</p>
                     <p>But then it was objected, that he ought to have limited the <hi>Truſt</hi> of the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> and of the <hi>Term</hi> both together; but <hi>F. D.</hi> by a diſtinct Clauſe in the <hi>Deed</hi> limits the <hi>Truſt</hi> of the <hi>Term</hi> which divides it, and makes it independent upon the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> the <hi>Truſt</hi> of which he limits by another Clauſe.</p>
                     <p>To that it was ſaid by the <hi>Court,</hi> that tho' the Limitations were by ſeveral Clauſes, yet all muſt be taken as one entire <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</hi> And <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid that in <hi>1646,</hi> a Leaſe for years was aſſigned, and the <hi>Truſt</hi> of it Entailed, and two days after the <hi>Truſt</hi> of the <hi>Inheritance</hi> Entailed in the ſame manner; and it was held by the beſt <hi>Counſel</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> that tho' this were done by ſeveral <hi>Deeds,</hi> and at ſeveral times; yet being in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of one Agreement, that all was to be taken as one entire <hi>Act,</hi> according to the Caſe of <hi>17 Jac.</hi> where a <hi>Fine</hi> was levied to <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years, with an intent that he ſhould ſuffer a <hi>Recovery,</hi> which was had the <hi>Term</hi> following, and reſolved that his <hi>Term</hi> was not drowned. The <hi>Jury</hi> hearing the Opinion of the <hi>Court</hi> found for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> for all, ſave a <hi>12th</hi> part, for ſo much was drowned and ſurrendred by the <hi>Aſſignment</hi> of <hi>F.

                     <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> were of <hi>Opinion,</hi> that it was not neceſſary to mention the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in the <hi>Plaint,</hi> for 'tis <hi>Lex loci,</hi> and they take notice of their own <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> in their own <hi>Courts;</hi> As in <hi>Norwich</hi> the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is, that in <hi>Debt</hi> upon a <hi>Specialty</hi> the <hi>Debtor fatetur Scriptum, ſed petit quod inquiratur de debito,</hi> and no <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is ſet forth in the <hi>Record</hi> to warrant that.

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> For that <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, No <hi>Action of Debt</hi> lies for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Money, tho' he which borrows it Promiſes to pay after the rate of <hi>6 l per Cent.</hi> for it; but it is to be recovered by <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> in <hi>Damages.</hi> So where by <hi>Deed</hi> the party Covenants or Binds himſelf to pay the <hi>Principal</hi> with <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the <hi>Intereſt</hi> is not to be included with the <hi>Principal</hi> in an Action of <hi>Debt,</hi> but ſhall be turned into <hi>Damages,</hi> which the <hi>Jury</hi> is to meaſure to what the <hi>Intereſt</hi> amounts to, which is allowed to be done; tho' indeed the <hi>Statutes</hi> (which permit the taking of <hi>Intereſt</hi>) ſay,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51792:106"/>
                        <hi>That Uſury is damned, and forbidden by the Law of God.</hi> And tho' it was Objected, <hi>That the Judgment is but Erroneous, and the Executor liable while Reverſed; and it cannot be ſaid, it was the Executor's fault to ſuffer it: For an Executor may plead a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him in Debt upon a ſimple Contract; tho' it could not have been recovered if he had pleaded to the Action, or without his voluntary Conſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Debt</hi> upon a <hi>Simple Contract</hi> lies againſt an <hi>Executor,</hi> if he pleaſe; nay, it hath been Adjudged, that an <hi>Executor</hi> may retain for a <hi>Debt</hi> but to him from the <hi>Teſtator,</hi> upon a <hi>Simple Contract:</hi> But in this Caſe no Action lies by the Law, nor any admiſſion of the <hi>Executor</hi> can make it good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It appears, that part of the <hi>Intereſt</hi> accrued after the <hi>Teſtator</hi>'s death, which is the <hi>Executors</hi> proper <hi>Debt,</hi> being his own default to ſuffer the <hi>Intereſt</hi> to run on: Then the Action being brought, both for that which is due in the <hi>Teſtator</hi>'s time, and for that which grew due ſince, is manifeſtly Erroneous; and there is nothing in the <hi>Defendants</hi> Plea to take away the <hi>Intendment,</hi> that he had <hi>Aſſets</hi> to ſatisfie at the <hi>Teſtator</hi>'s death.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Newport</hi> was ſeiſed of an Houſe called <hi>Newport-Houſe,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and had three Sons, who are yet living, and had two Daughters. <hi>Iſabel</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> by whom ſhe had Iſſue <hi>Anne</hi> the <hi>Defendant;</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> married to <hi>Porter,</hi> by whom ſhe had Iſſue <hi>George Porter</hi> Leſſor of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and made his Will in this manner:</p>

                        <hi>
                           <hi>Anne Knolles</hi> (viz.</hi> the Defendant) <hi>and the Heirs of her Body: Provided always, and upon Condition, that ſhe Marries with the Conſent of my ſaid Wife, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> or the major part of them: And in caſe ſhe Marries without ſuch Conſent, or happen to dye without Iſſue, then I give and bequeath it to <hi>George Porter,</hi> (viz.</hi> the Leſſor of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.)</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Newport</hi> dies, and the Lady <hi>Anne Knolles</hi> being of the Age of <hi>14</hi> years, marries with <hi>Fry</hi> without the Conſent of her Grandmother, or either of the Earls; and it was found, that ſhe had no Notice of the <hi>Will</hi> until after the Marriage, and that <hi>George Porter</hi> at that time was of the Age of <hi>8</hi> years; and that after the Death of the Counteſs ſhe Entred, and <hi>George Porter</hi> Entred upon her, and made the Leaſe to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It was this <hi>Term</hi> Reſolved by the <hi>Court, (viz.) Hale, Twiſden</hi> and <hi>Rainsford,</hi> (<hi>Moreton</hi> being abſent) for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> upon theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rainsford.</hi> Here have been three Queſtions made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether the words in the <hi>Will,</hi> whereby the marriage of the <hi>Defendant</hi> is reſtrained, make a <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Limitation:</hi> If a <hi>Condition,</hi> then none but the <hi>Heir</hi> can Enter for the Breach. But 'tis clear, that they muſt be taken as a <hi>Limitation,</hi> to ſupport the intent of the <hi>Deviſor,</hi> and to let in the Remainder which he limits over, <hi>1 Rolls 411.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhall excuſe her in this Breach, and clearly it cannot: For a <hi>Condition</hi> in <hi>Deed</hi> obliges <hi>Infants</hi> as much as others, <hi>8 Co. 42. Whittingham's Caſe,</hi> the difference between <hi>Conditions in Fact</hi> and <hi>Conditions in Law.</hi> Eſpecially in this Caſe, the nature of the <hi>Condition</hi> ſhewing it to be therefore impoſed upon her, becauſe ſhe was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (and the main Point of the Caſe,) Whether the want of <hi>Notice</hi> ſhall ſave the Forfeiture of the <hi>Eſtate?</hi> As to that, Let the <hi>Rules of Law</hi> concerning <hi>Notice</hi> be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I take a difference where the <hi>Deviſee,</hi> who is to perform the <hi>Condition,</hi> is <hi>Heir at Law;</hi> and where a <hi>Stranger.</hi> The <hi>Heir</hi> muſt have Notice, becauſe he having a Title by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> need not take notice of any Will, unleſs it be ſignified to him. And ſo is <hi>Fraunce's Caſe, 8 Co.</hi> Where the <hi>Heir</hi> was <hi>Deviſee</hi> for <hi>60</hi> years, upon Condition not to diſturb the <hi>Executor</hi> in removing the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51792:107"/>
                        <hi>Goods;</hi> and Reſolved that he ſhould not loſe his <hi>Eſtate</hi> upon a Diſturbance, before he had Notice of the <hi>Will.</hi> But where the <hi>Deviſee</hi> is not <hi>Heir,</hi> (as in this Caſe) he muſt inform himſelf of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> deviſed to him, and upon what terms.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Rule</hi> is, When one of the Parties is more privy than the other, <hi>Notice</hi> muſt be given; but where the Privity is equal, <hi>Notice</hi> muſt be taken by the party concerned. A <hi>Bargainee</hi> ſhall not Enter for a <hi>Condition</hi> broken, before Notice, for the <hi>Bargain and Sale</hi> lies in his Cognizance, and not the <hi>Leſſees.</hi> So if a Leaſe be made to commence after the end of the former; if the firſt be ſurrendred, the <hi>Leſſor</hi> ſhall not Enter for a <hi>Condition</hi> broken for <hi>Non payment of Rent,</hi> until Notice given of the <hi>Surrender, 3 Leon. 95.</hi> And therefore there ſhall be no Lapſe to the <hi>Ordinary</hi> upon a <hi>Reſignation,</hi> without <hi>Notice.</hi> If a man makes a <hi>Feoffment,</hi> upon Condition to Enter upon payment of ſuch a Sum at a place certain, he muſt give Notice to the <hi>Feoffee</hi> when he will tender the Money, <hi>Co. Lir. 211. a. Dyer 354.</hi> And upon this Reaſon is <hi>Molineux's Caſe, 2 Cro. 144.</hi> where a <hi>Deviſe</hi> was, that his <hi>Heir</hi> ſhould pay ſuch <hi>Rents,</hi> and if he made default, then his <hi>Executors</hi> ſhould have the Lands, paying the ſaid <hi>Rents;</hi> and if they failed of Payment, then he deviſed the Land to his younger <hi>Children,</hi> to whom the <hi>Rents</hi> were to be paid. It was Reſolved, <hi>Non-payment</hi> by the <hi>Executors</hi> ſhould be no Breach, until they had <hi>Notice</hi> that the <hi>Heir</hi> had failed, which was a thing that the younger <hi>Children</hi> muſt be privy to. But in <hi>22 E. 4. 27, 28. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for Life</hi> Lets for years, and dies; the <hi>Leſſee</hi> muſt remove in convenient time, to be reckoned from the death of the <hi>Tenant,</hi> whether he had <hi>Notice</hi> of it or no: For he in Reverſion is preſumed to be no more privy to it than himſelf. So <hi>Gymlett and Sands's Caſe. 3 Cro. 391.</hi> and <hi>1 Rolls 856.</hi> where <hi>Baron</hi> and <hi>Feme</hi> were <hi>Tenants for Life,</hi> Remainder to the Son in tail, Remainder to the right Heirs of the <hi>Baron;</hi> the <hi>Baron</hi> makes a <hi>Feoffment with Warranty</hi> and dies, then the <hi>Feme</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> joyn in a <hi>Feoffment;</hi> this is a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of <hi>F.</hi> tho' ſhe had no Notice of the <hi>Feoffment</hi> or <hi>Warranty,</hi> whereby the Right of the <hi>Son</hi> was bound.

B.</hi> dies before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the <hi>Heir</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> is bound to pay the <hi>10 l</hi> without any Notice given by <hi>A.</hi> The Reaſon given (which comes home to our Caſe) is, <hi>For that none is bound to give Notice,</hi> and then it muſt be taken; tho' indeed a ſecond be added, <hi>For that B.</hi> (from whom his <hi>Heir</hi> derives) <hi>had Notice.</hi> The <hi>Mayor and Comminalty of London aganſt Atford, 1 Cro.</hi> where a <hi>Deviſe</hi> was to ſix Perſons, to pay certain Sums for the Maintenance of an <hi>Almſhouſe, &amp;c.</hi> and if through Obliviouſneſs, or other
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51792:108"/>
Cauſe, the <hi>Truſts</hi> were not performed, then to <hi>J. S.</hi> upon the ſame Condition; and if he failed by two <hi>Months,</hi> then to the <hi>Mayor and Comminalty</hi> of <hi>London</hi> upon the ſame <hi>Truſts.</hi> The ſix did not perform the <hi>Truſts, J.S.</hi> enters, <hi>J. N.</hi> enters upon him, and a <hi>Fine with Proclamations</hi> was levied, and Five years paſſed; and the better Opinion was, that the <hi>Mayor and Comminalty of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were bound to pay the Money appointed by the <hi>Will,</hi> altho' they had no Notice that the ſix perſons or <hi>J. S.</hi> had failed; tho' indeed the Caſe is adjudged againſt them, as being barred by the <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim.</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Corbet's Caſe, 4 Co.</hi> is very ſtrong to this purpoſe; where a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is to <hi>J. S.</hi> until he ſhall or may raiſe ſuch a Sum out of the <hi>Profits</hi> of the Land: If a <hi>Stranger</hi> Enters after the death of the <hi>Deviſor,</hi> tho' the <hi>Deviſee</hi> had no Notice of the <hi>Will,</hi> yet the time ſhall run on, as much as if he had the Land in his own poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Rules</hi> being applied to the preſent Caſe, it will appear no <hi>Notice</hi> is to be given:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Defendant</hi> is as privy to the <hi>Will</hi> as any one elſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as <hi>George Porter,</hi> who is found alſo to be an <hi>Infant.</hi> It is not found whether there were any <hi>Executors,</hi> if it had, they were not concerned to give <hi>Notice,</hi> nor did it import the <hi>Heir:</hi> For he could have neither benefit or loſs by the <hi>Condition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Two Caſes</hi> which have been chiefly relyed upon for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> were, firſt <hi>France's Caſe,</hi> which differs, becauſe it was in caſe of an <hi>Heir.</hi> Secondly, the Caſe of <hi>Sanders and Carwell, 8 Jac.</hi> in a private <hi>Report</hi> of Sir <hi>Geoffrey Palmer,</hi> the <hi>Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> in which there is no clear account of the Caſe, and we cannot find the <hi>Roll:</hi> It was a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to his Wife for life, Remainder to his Daughter in tail, upon Condition to pay Money; and it was held that the <hi>Non-payment</hi> would be no breach unleſs ſhe had <hi>Notice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, It was an Opinion only upon <hi>Evidence,</hi> and <hi>Lea</hi> and <hi>Chamberlain</hi> only in <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, For ought appears the Daughter might be <hi>Heir,</hi> and then 'tis good Law.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It appears there was a foul Concealment of the <hi>Will</hi> for Four years time; within which time (for ought appears) the <hi>Condition</hi> was to have been performed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> was of the ſame Opinion; but I omit his <hi>Argument,</hi> becauſe I could not hear him perfectly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale</hi> was of the ſame Opinion. As to the firſt <hi>Point,</hi> I ſhall diſcharge the Caſe of it, as not fit to be called in queſtion: For without peradventure tho' the word <hi>Condition</hi> be uſed, yet limiting a Remainder over, makes it a <hi>Limitation;</hi> for ſo 'tis plain the <hi>Teſtator</hi> meant, and 'tis as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>And if ſhe Marries, &amp;c. then to remain,</hi> without the word <hi>Condition.</hi>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51792:108"/>
And this hath received as many <hi>Reſolutions</hi> as ever any Point did, <hi>(viz.) Wiſeman and Baldwin's Caſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Leon. 51. Owen 412. 1 Leon. 383.</note> 
                        <hi>18 Eliz. 1 Rolls 412. Hainſ worth and Pretty, 3 Cro 833. and 2 Cro. Pells and Browne's Caſe,</hi> with a great many more; and nothing but the Opinion in <hi>Mary Portington's Caſe, 10 Co.</hi> againſt it.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Fynch, Attorney General,</hi> Argued this Caſe, he obſerved that <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf was of another Opinion in the <hi>3d Report,</hi> in <hi>Wellock and Hammond's Caſe,</hi> cited in <hi>Boraſton's Caſe:</hi> For tho' there 'tis the word <hi>Paying</hi> only, which is adjudged a <hi>Limitation;</hi> yet <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Quaere</hi> in <hi>Dyer 317.</hi> is upon that well Reſolved, and the Caſe in <hi>Dyer</hi> is upon the word <hi>Condition</hi> expreſly.</p>
                     <p>Then to proceed to the other Matters. Here is an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> deviſed to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> ſubject to <hi>Two Limitations,</hi> the one of <hi>Law, (viz.) Dying without Iſſue;</hi> the other expreſs and in Fact, <hi>(viz) Marrying without the conſent, &amp;c. and both are coupled together, ſo that whenever ſhe Marries without Conſent, &amp;c. her Eſtate determines and is transferred to him in Remainder, without either Entry or Claim.</hi> 'Tis all one as if the <hi>Eſtate</hi> had been deviſed to her for Life, and if ſhe Marries, then to remain, which had been but an Eſtate <hi>quamdiu ſola vixerit:</hi> And it is to be obſerved, that if her Marriage here be no breach of the <hi>Conditional Limitation</hi> (for ſo 'tis properly called) becauſe ſhe had no <hi>Notice,</hi> then it can never be broken: So that the <hi>Queſtion</hi> muſt be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a <hi>Marriage</hi> ſhall diſcharge the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of it, and make it become abſolute.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, where the <hi>Condition</hi> requires ſuch an Act to be done, as may be done after <hi>Notice,</hi> in hath been queſtioned, whether the <hi>Law</hi> ſhall not protract the <hi>Time</hi> limited for performance, until <hi>Notice</hi> be had, <hi>1 Cro. Alford's Caſe,</hi> which was a <hi>Condition</hi> for <hi>Payment of Money:</hi> But this is a thing of that nature, that being done, no ſubſequent <hi>Notice</hi> can ever retrieve.</p>
                     <p>Then 'tis to Enquire, How far the want of <hi>Notice</hi> will excuſe? It muſt be conſidered, that 'tis a <hi>Will</hi> made by a perſon now dead, who can give no <hi>Notice,</hi> neither can any come to the knowledge of it without Enquiry, and one hath the ſame means to obtain it with another; and the perſon who would take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, muſt make the beſt Enquiry he can. If a <hi>Deviſe</hi> were made to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> it was her Concern to Enquire upon what terms; until then how can it be aſcertained, whether ſhe will take it? And ſo it was <hi>Porter's</hi> Buſineſs to Enquire; no difference between them in this reſpect. So that upon theſe Five Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, it will appear, that no <hi>Notice</hi> is requiſite to be given in this Caſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:51792:109"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Teſtator</hi> hath not appointed any <hi>Notice</hi> to be given, than he which was the <hi>Diſpoſer</hi> might give upon what terms he pleaſed; and this Matter of <hi>Notice</hi> ſhall not be added, unleſs it were in a Caſe wherein the <hi>Law</hi> would very ſtrongly require it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe there is no Perſon who can reaſonably be engaged to give <hi>Notice (viz.)</hi> not the <hi>Heir,</hi> for he is Diſinherited; not the <hi>Executors,</hi> for they are not concerned in the <hi>Freehold;</hi> nor the <hi>Truſtees,</hi> for they have but their labour for their pains; nor <hi>Porter,</hi> for he is no more bound to give than ſhe to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe each Party have the ſame means of Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves of the <hi>Will, (i.e.)</hi> by <hi>Enquiry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It more imported the <hi>Defendant</hi> to know it, as relating to her own <hi>Intereſt;</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> which gives the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> gives it upon this <hi>Conditional Limitation. Corbet's Caſe, 4 Co.</hi> comes very cloſe; where, if the <hi>Deviſee</hi> ſtays while the time wherein the <hi>Money</hi> might be raiſed is elapſed, he ſhall never raiſe it after. Suppoſe a man dies poſſeſſed of a <hi>Term</hi> upon which a great <hi>Rent</hi> is reſerved; ſhall the <hi>Executor,</hi> after that he hath proved the <hi>Will</hi> throw up the <hi>Term,</hi> as pretending not to have known of it? An <hi>Eſtate</hi> is deviſed to one <hi>durante Viduitate;</hi> ſhall ſhe Marry, and becauſe ſhe had do Notice of the <hi>Will,</hi> hold the <hi>Eſtate</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely for her Life? There is the ſame Reaſon in this Caſe; for this <hi>Proviſo</hi> is a part of the <hi>Limitation</hi> of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> it ſelf. No man is preſumed to be ignorant of his own Intereſt; and as he muſt take Notice to acquire, ſo of the manner of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> he gains. He that gave it thus, was not obliged to do ſo much.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It was not impoſſible for the <hi>Defendant</hi> to have made Enquiry, and ſhe muſt not take advantage of her <hi>Latches.</hi> A <hi>Bond</hi> with <hi>Condition</hi> to pay <hi>50 l</hi> when the <hi>Obligee</hi> ſhall marry the <hi>Obligor's Kinſwoman;</hi> in <hi>Debt</hi> upon this, it was Reſolved, that the <hi>Obligee</hi> was not bound to give Notice of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> tho' it lay in his own privity; becauſe the <hi>Obligor</hi> might have known it by other means, <hi>Hill. 1650. Between Try and . . . . Rot. 1081. B. R.</hi> It was proper for the <hi>Defendant</hi> to have Enquired, whether her Grandfather gave her any thing: And ſo it was for him that ſhould marry her.<note place="margin">Ante.</note> 
                        <hi>Harwood's Caſe</hi> Adjudged here <hi>(Hill. ult.)</hi> was upon this Reaſon: He married a <hi>City Orphan</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and was fined by the <hi>Court of Orphans,</hi> becauſe he had not firſt applied himſelf to them for their <hi>Licence, &amp;c.</hi> according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>City:</hi> And the <hi>Fine</hi> was Reſolved here to be well impoſed, tho' he had no Notice that ſhe whom he married was an <hi>Orphan;</hi> becauſe it was his buſineſs to enquire of the Condition of her whom he will make his Wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51792:109"/>Then the next thing to be conſidered is the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> and that is nothing in this Caſe. <hi>Porter</hi> who was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bableſt perſon to give notice is found to be an <hi>Infant</hi> too. Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Fact bind <hi>Infants.</hi> Again, the Condition here relates to an <hi>Act,</hi> which ſhe is capable of doing. The <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Merton</hi> which Enacts, <hi>Non currant uſurae, &amp;c.</hi> whereby <hi>Infants</hi> are exempted from <hi>Penalties;</hi> yet in another <hi>Chapter</hi> gives the Forfeiture of the ſaid double value to the <hi>Lord</hi> where his <hi>Ward Marries</hi> without his conſent. 'Tis a reſtraint laid upon her in a matter proper for her Condition, and with reſpect to her Condition, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>Infant,</hi> ſhe might adviſe with her <hi>Friends</hi> about her <hi>Marriage.</hi> The Caſes which have been objected do not come to this Caſe, as the <hi>Opinion</hi> in <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Carwells Caſe,</hi> which might be good <hi>Law,</hi> if it could be known what that caſe was, for the words might either explicitly or implicitly require notice, as if they were, <hi>if he refuſed to pay, &amp;c.</hi> or it may be no time might be ſet for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for in <hi>Molineux Caſe,</hi> there <hi>Rents</hi> were granted, and after a Deviſe for the payment of them which naturally lie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There it concerned the younger <hi>Children</hi> to give notice; for the <hi>Rents</hi> were not only to be paid to them, but upon failer of payment the <hi>Land</hi> was Deviſed to them; So that was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of concern in them, as to the performance of the Condition, and the <hi>Eſtate</hi> they ſhould acquire by the Breach. Whereas the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in this Caſe, is not concerned in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The penning of the Condition were quite differs; for 'tis <hi>upon default of payment,</hi> which implies notice muſt be firſt had. In <hi>Frances Caſe,</hi> there would have been no need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, if the Deviſe had not béen to the <hi>Heir,</hi> which is the only thing wherein it differs materially from this Caſe. In <hi>Alfords Caſe,</hi> the debate was occaſioned by the ſpecial penning; for it was thus, that if <hi>thorough Obliviouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Truſts</hi> ſhould not happen to be performed. Now there could be no <hi>Oblivion</hi> of that they never knew; therefore there is ſome Opinion there, that the <hi>Mayor and Citizens</hi> of <hi>L.</hi> ought to have had a precedent notice; yet the <hi>Judgment</hi> is contrary, for they could not have been bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim,</hi> if notice had been neceſſary to the <hi>Commencement</hi> of their <hi>Title;</hi> and 'tis not found, whether thoſe to whom the <hi>Eſtate</hi> was deviſed, before had notice; ſo that this cauſe proves rather, that there needs no notice in this caſe, than otherwiſe. Wherefore the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> muſt have his <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> had concluded. <hi>Rainsford</hi> ſaid, he had ſpoken with <hi>Juſtice Moreton,</hi> who declared to him, that he was of the ſame Opinion.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51792:114"/>
ſhe ſhould enjoy for her Life. The <hi>Deviſor</hi> dies, <hi>Barnard</hi> ſuffers a <hi>Recovery</hi> to the uſe of himſelf in <hi>Fee,</hi> and after Covenanted to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of his Wife for her <hi>Joynture for Life,</hi> and died without Iſſue by any ſecond Wife. The Queſtion was, Whether the Wife had a good <hi>Eſtate,</hi> or that <hi>J. Melling</hi> in <hi>Remainder</hi> had the Right?</p>
                     <p>It was Argued for <hi>John Melling;</hi> Firſt, That <hi>Barnard Melling</hi> had only an <hi>Eſtate for Life</hi> by this Deviſe. Indeed, if it had been to him and his Iſſue which he ſhould have by the ſecond Wife, that would have been an <hi>Entail;</hi> but here 'tis expreſly given to him for his Life. The Caſe of <hi>Wiat Wield, 8 Co. 78. b.</hi> is full to this: A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to a man and his Children is an <hi>Eſtate Tail,</hi> if he hath none at the time: But if the <hi>Deviſe</hi> were to a man for his Life, and after his Deceaſe to his Children; there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had Children or no at the time, they take by way of <hi>Remainder</hi> either contingent or veſted: So <hi>Archer's Caſe, 1 Co. 1 Rolls 837.</hi> A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to his Son for Life, the <hi>Remainder</hi> to the Sons of his Body lawfully begotten; the Son takes only an <hi>Eſtate for Life,</hi> becauſe ſo expreſly limited. Then the <hi>Recovery</hi> deſtroys this <hi>Contingent Remainder,</hi> and ſo alſo the power of appointing a <hi>Joynture</hi> to his Wife: For 'tis not a bare <hi>Collateral Power,</hi> but annexed to his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and therefore extinguiſhes in the Conveyance of it.</p>
                     <p>But admitting it were ſtill in him, yet he did not well execute it, which ſhould have been in ſuch manner as it might have taken effect by the <hi>Will,</hi> and not to ariſe upon a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeiſed.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide it was Argued, that it was an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> in <hi>Barnard Melling,</hi> and no <hi>Remainder</hi> contingent to the Iſſue: For there a <hi>Remainder</hi> is ſaid to be contingent where the firſt <hi>Eſtate</hi> may fail before 'tis aſcertained whether the <hi>Contingent</hi> will happen or no; here if it be an Entail, <hi>Barnard Melling</hi> hath it for his Life, and the <hi>Iſſue</hi> had nothing until after his deceaſe. So 'tis but an <hi>Expreſſio eorum quae tacite inſunt.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> ſtrongly inclined, that no <hi>Prohibition</hi> ought to go in this Caſe; for the Reaſon that <hi>21 H. 8.</hi> requires, <hi>That Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſhould be granted to the next of Kin</hi> was, upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <hi>That the Inteſtate intended to prefer him:</hi> But now the <hi>Preſumption</hi> is here taken away, the <hi>Reſiduum</hi> being diſpoſed of to another; and to what purpoſe ſhould the <hi>next of Kin</hi> have it, when no benefit can accrue to him by it? and 'tis reaſonable that he ſhould have the management of the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> who is to have what remains of it, after the <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Legacies</hi> paid. And the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That there is no <hi>Reſiduum,</hi>
                        </hi> is not material; for being once out of the <hi>Statute,</hi> upon Conſtruction of the Words of the <hi>Will,</hi> there is nothing <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> can bring it within it. And there are certain <hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> which have been always <hi>Ruled</hi> to be out of the <hi>Statute,</hi> as <hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> during <hi>Minority, &amp; pendente lite,</hi> which need not be granted to the <hi>next of Kin,</hi> and granting it to the <hi>Husband</hi> comes not within the Words of the <hi>Statute.</hi> But becauſe in this caſe, <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> had been granted ſo long before the <hi>Reſiduary Legatee</hi> came in, and the <hi>Adminiſtrators</hi> by <hi>Decrees</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi> had got in great part of the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and ſtill there were Suits depending there for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the reſt, which were near their <hi>Effect;</hi> which would be abated and ſet aſide if the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> were now <hi>Repealed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> propoſed an Accommodation, as moſt uſeful to either of the Parties, and advantagious to the Eſtate; which was accepted.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Civilians</hi> ſaid, <hi>That a Legatee that had got Adminiſtration, tho' it were after Repealed upon a Citation, ſhould yet retain for his Legacy.</hi> Otherwiſe upon an <hi>Appeal;</hi> for there the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> is avoided <hi>ab initio.

mainly upon <hi>Wilds Caſe, 6 Co.</hi> which was brought before all the <hi>Judges of England;</hi> where the <hi>Deviſe</hi> was to a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and after their deceaſe to the <hi>Children,</hi> and reſolved to be but an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life;</hi> 'tis true, there were <hi>Children</hi> at the time of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> but in the end of the Caſe 'tis ſaid, that in ſuch Caſe if there were no <hi>Children,</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> born after might take by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and the firſt <hi>Eſtate</hi> to be but for <hi>Life.

                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> point, Whether the power to make a <hi>Joynture</hi> be deſtroyed by the <hi>Common Recovery;</hi> theſe powers to make <hi>Eſtates</hi> are of two ſorts, either <hi>Collateral,</hi> as when <hi>Executors</hi> have power by a <hi>Will</hi> to ſell <hi>Land,</hi> and ſuch a power cannot be deſtroyed as appears in <hi>Diggs's Caſe, 1 Co.</hi> or powers appendant to <hi>Eſtates</hi> as to make <hi>Leaſes,</hi> which ſhall continue after the <hi>Eſtates,</hi> to which the power is annexed determins; and the power in the Caſe at <hi>Bar</hi> to make a <hi>Joynture</hi> are of this ſecond ſort, and are deſtroyed by the alteration of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> to which it is annexed in privity, as <hi>1 Co.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But admitting the power continues, whether it be well executed; and I hold that it is not, for being ſeized in <hi>Fee</hi> at the time of the <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized to the uſe of his <hi>Wife</hi> for her <hi>Joynture;</hi> and this without any reference to his power, the uſe ſhall ariſe out of his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and not be executed by vertue of his power, according to the reſolution in <hi>Sir Ed. Cleeres Caſe, 6 Co.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden</hi> of the ſame Opinion. As to the <hi>firſt</hi> Point it muſt be agreed, that theſe words <hi>Iſſue</hi> of the <hi>Body ex vi termini</hi> make not an <hi>Entail,</hi> if they were in a <hi>Conveyance</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> executed, no more than <hi>Children,</hi> as the words were in <hi>Wilds Caſe.</hi> 'Tis true, in a <hi>VVill</hi> a <hi>Deviſe</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> to a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Iſſue</hi> creates an <hi>Entail,</hi> if the <hi>Deviſee</hi> had no <hi>Iſſue</hi> at that time, for otherwiſe thoſe words would be void; for in regard they are limited to take preſently, the <hi>Iſſue</hi> born after, cannot take as by Remainder, there being none to take in <hi>praeſenti,</hi> they muſt be intended to be words of <hi>Limitation;</hi> as a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Heirs Males</hi> makes an <hi>Entail,</hi> or otherwiſe the word <hi>Males</hi> muſt be rejected; then ſeeing the words in themſelves are not proper to make an <hi>Entail,</hi> the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51792:120"/>
next thing to be conſidered is the intention, (which is to be known by the expreſſions in the <hi>VVill,</hi> and not any averment <hi>dehors,</hi>) the words are, <hi>J will give my Land to my Son for Life, and after his deceaſe, I will give the ſame to the Iſſue, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that the <hi>Land</hi> is given to him expreſly for <hi>Life. Deviſe</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> in <hi>perpetuum</hi> makes <hi>Fee,</hi> but if <hi>Land</hi> be given by <hi>Deèd</hi> in <hi>perpetuum,</hi> there an <hi>Eſtate</hi> only for <hi>Life</hi> will paſs, <hi>15 H. 7.</hi> A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to one paying <hi>10 l</hi> this is a <hi>Fee, 6 Co. Coliers Caſe:</hi> But a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to one for <hi>Life</hi> paying <hi>10 l</hi> makes but an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life;</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Furſe and VVinter</hi> was, <hi>Mich. or Trin. 13 Regis Caroli Rot. 1339.</hi> A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to his two <hi>Daughters</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be divided between them, and to the <hi>Survivor</hi> of them, and to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Survivor.</hi> This was ſo expreſly to the <hi>Surviror,</hi> that it was reſolved to be a <hi>Joynt Eſtate,</hi> and not in <hi>Common.</hi> The words here are after the deceaſe of <hi>Bernard, I give the ſame to the Iſſue of the Body, &amp;c.</hi> implying that the <hi>Iſſue</hi> ſhould take by Purchaſe as a <hi>Gift,</hi> and not by <hi>Deſcent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, The power given to <hi>Bernard</hi> to make a <hi>Joynture</hi> ſhews, that he could not do it by <hi>Virtue</hi> of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and therefore needed a power to be annexed. And tho' ſuch powers are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affixed to <hi>Eſtates Tail;</hi> yet when the conſtruction is doubtful, what <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſhall paſs, the giving ſuch a power is an argument, that 'tis ſuch an <hi>Eſtate,</hi> that cannot make a <hi>Joynture,</hi> or the like by any other means. The words go further, and for want of ſuch <hi>Iſſue,</hi> then to <hi>J.M.</hi> 'Tis true, if <hi>Land</hi> be deviſed to a <hi>Man,</hi> and if he dies without <hi>Iſſue</hi> then to remain, over the <hi>Deviſee</hi> ſhall have an <hi>Entail. Owen 29.</hi> But it ſhall not be ſo in this Caſe, becauſe that Clauſe is crowded in with other Clauſes directly to the contrary. I rely mainly upon <hi>VVilds Caſe, 6 Co.</hi> and the Caſe quoted out of <hi>Bendlowes</hi> in the end of that Caſe, A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to <hi>Baron</hi> and <hi>Feme,</hi> and to the <hi>Men Children</hi> of their <hi>Bodies</hi> begotten; becauſe it did not appear that there were any more <hi>Children,</hi> at that time; this made an <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi> But if it had béen, and after their deceaſe to their <hi>Children,</hi> then the <hi>Children</hi> ſhould take by Purchaſe tho' born after. 'Tis true, that caſe is variouſly reported in the <hi>Books,</hi> but I adhere to my <hi>Lord Coke,</hi> preſuming, that being brought before all the <hi>Judges</hi> in the <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>VVilds Caſe,</hi> it was a true Report.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond Point 'tis plain, that the power is extinguiſhed, for by the <hi>Recovery,</hi> the <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life</hi> to which it was annexed in privity is gone and forfeited, ſo that 'tis not neceſſary to diſpute the third Point, whether well executed or no: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, I agree with my <hi>Brother Rainsford,</hi> that the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> ought to have <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale.</hi> I differ from my two <hi>Brothers,</hi> and tho' I was of their Opinion at the finding of the <hi>Special Verdict;</hi> yet upon very great Conſideration of the Caſe, I am of Opinion for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi> I ſhall proceed in a different method from my <hi>Brothers,</hi> and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51792:121"/>
begin with that Point which they made laſt; and I agree with them, admitting that <hi>Bernard</hi> had but an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> that the power was deſtroyed; alſo here the <hi>Recovery</hi> does not only bar the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> but all powers annexed to it, for the recompence in value is of ſuch ſtrong Conſideration, that it ſerves as well for <hi>Rents, Poſſibilities, &amp;c.</hi> going out of and depending upon the <hi>Land,</hi> as for the <hi>Land</hi> it ſelf: So <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Feoffments</hi> do ranſack the whole <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and paſs, or extinguiſh, &amp;c. all <hi>Rights, Conditions, Powers, &amp;c.</hi> belonging to the <hi>Land,</hi> as well as the <hi>Land</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I agree with my <hi>Brother Rainsford,</hi> that if <hi>Bernard</hi> had but an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life</hi> by the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> the power was not well executed. Where <hi>Tenant</hi> for <hi>Life</hi> has a power to make <hi>Leaſes,</hi> 'tis not always neceſſary to recite his power when he makes a <hi>Leaſe;</hi> but if he makes a <hi>Leaſe,</hi> which will not have an effectual continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if it be directed out of his intereſt, there it ſhall be as made by virtue of his power; and ſo it was reſolved in one <hi>Roger's Caſe,</hi> in which I was <hi>Counſel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Tho' it be here by <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized, an improper way to execute his power; yet it might be conſtrued an <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, <hi>Mich. 51.</hi> In this <hi>Court, Stapleton's Caſe,</hi> where a <hi>Deviſe</hi> was to <hi>A.</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> Remainder to <hi>B.</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> Remainder to <hi>C.</hi> in <hi>Fee,</hi> with power to <hi>B.</hi> to make his <hi>Wife</hi> a <hi>Joynture. B.</hi> covenanted to ſtand ſeized for the <hi>Joynture</hi> of his <hi>Wife,</hi> reciting his power, tho' this could not make a legal <hi>Joynture;</hi> yet it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to enure by virtue of his power, <hi>quando non valet quod ago ut ago valeat quantum valere poteſt.</hi> But in this Caſe <hi>Bernard</hi> has got a new <hi>Fee,</hi> which tho' it be defeaſible by him in Remainder; yet the <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized ſhall enure thereupon, and the uſe ſhall ariſe out of the <hi>Fee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I was at the firſt opening of the Caſe of Opinion, that <hi>Bernard</hi> had but an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> but upon deep Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Will,</hi> and of the Authority, and Conſiderations of the Conſequences of the Caſe, I hold it to be an <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And firſt to eaſe that Point of all difficulties, if cannot be denied; but a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to a <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Heirs</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> by a ſecond <hi>Wife</hi> makes an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> executed, tho' the <hi>Deviſee</hi> had a <hi>Wife</hi> at the time. As the Caſe often cited, <hi>Land</hi> given to a <hi>Married Man</hi> and a <hi>Married Woman,</hi> and the <hi>Heirs</hi> of their <hi>Bodies.</hi> We are here in caſe of the Creation of an <hi>Eſtate-Tail,</hi> where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention has ſome influence <hi>(voluntas Donatoris, &amp;c.)</hi> and may help words which are not exactly according to legal form, <hi>39 Aſs. 20.

                     </p>
                     <p>Again, I agree, if a <hi>Deviſe</hi> be made to a man, and after his death to his Iſſue (or Children,) having Iſſue at that time, they take by way of <hi>Remainder</hi> And that was the only Point adjudged in <hi>Wild's Caſe,</hi> and there alſo againſt the Opinion of <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Gawdy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This way being made, I come to the Caſe it ſelf, and ſhall briefly give my <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why I hold <hi>Bernard</hi> has an <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the word <hi>Iſſue</hi> is <hi>nomen collectivum,</hi> and takes in the whole Generation <hi>ex vi termini;</hi> and ſo the Caſe is ſtronger than if it were <hi>Children:</hi> And where 'tis ſaid, <hi>to the Iſſue that he ſhall have of the Body of the ſecond Wife;</hi> that is, <hi>all that ſhall come of the ſecond Wife:</hi> For ſo 'tis underſtood in common Parlance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament, Exitus</hi> is as comprehenſive as <hi>Heirs of the Body.</hi> In <hi>Weſtm. 2. de donis, Iſſue</hi> is made a term of equivalence to <hi>Heirs of the Body;</hi> for where it ſpeaks of the Alienation of the <hi>Donee,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>quo minus ad exitum diſcenderet.</hi> So in <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> of <hi>Entails</hi> ſetled by the <hi>Crown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, in <hi>Conveyances, &amp;c.</hi> the wiſdom of the Law has appropriated the word <hi>Heirs</hi> as a <hi>Term of Art.</hi> In <hi>Clerke's Caſe:</hi> A Leaſe was made to commence after the death of his Son without <hi>Iſſue;</hi> the Son had a Son and died, and then that Son died without Iſſue.

                     <p>But now to ſee the difference: <hi>Tyler's Caſe, Mich. 34 Eliz. B.R.</hi> He had Iſſue <hi>A. B.

                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:51792:122"/>Reſolved, that the Son of <hi>A.</hi> ſhould not take as one of the Children of the <hi>Teſtator.</hi> Which Caſe I cite, to ſhew the odds between the word <hi>Iſſue</hi> and the word <hi>Children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My ſecond <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from the manner of the <hi>Limitation,</hi> which is to his <hi>Iſſue;</hi> and <hi>of his Body lawfully begotten upon the ſecond Wife,</hi> Phraſes agreeable to an <hi>Eſtate Tail;</hi> and the meaning of a <hi>Teſtator</hi> is to be ſpelled out by little Hints. It is admitted in <hi>Wild's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>6 Co. 17.</hi> that if the <hi>Deviſe</hi> had been, to the <hi>Children of their Bodies,</hi> it would have been an Entail.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It appears by the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> that the <hi>Teſtator</hi> knew there could be no Children at that time, and ſhall not be ſuppoſed to intend a contingent Remainder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It appears that the <hi>Teſtator</hi> did not intend to prefer the Children of the firſt Wife of <hi>Bernard,</hi> but did the Children of the ſecond, and therefore cannot be thought to mean, that <hi>John</hi> the younger Brother of <hi>Bernard</hi> ſhould take before failure of the Iſſue which <hi>Bernard</hi> ſhould have by his ſecond Wife. And to this purpoſe is <hi>Spalding's Caſe, 3 Cro. 185.</hi> A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to his eldeſt Son and the Heirs of his Body after the death of his Wife; and if he died living the Wife, then to his Son <hi>N.</hi> And deviſed other Lands to another Son, and the Heirs of his Body; and if he died <hi>without Iſſue, then to remain, &amp;c. The firſt Son died living the Wife.</hi> It was ſtrongly urged, that his Eſtate ſhould ceaſe; for being ſaid, <hi>If he died living the Wife,</hi> this was a Corrective of what went before. But 'twas Ruled by all the <hi>Court,</hi> that it was an abſolute <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> in the firſt Son, as if the words had been, <hi>If he died without Iſſue living the Wife;</hi> for he could not be thought to intend to prefer a younger Son before the Iſſue of his eldeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The words are further, <hi>and for want of ſuch Iſſue, then to <hi>John;</hi>
                        </hi> which words in a <hi>Will</hi> do often make an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> by Implication. As <hi>4 Jac. Robinſon's Caſe:</hi> A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> for Life, and if he died without Iſſue, then to remain; <hi>A.</hi> took an <hi>Entail.</hi> So <hi>Burley's Caſe, 43 Eliz.</hi> A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> for Life, <hi>Remainder</hi> to the next <hi>Heir Male;</hi> and for default of ſuch <hi>Heir Male,</hi> then to remain. Adjudged an <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Dyer 171.</hi> is, where Lands were Deviſed to a man and the <hi>Heirs Males</hi> of his Body, and if he died <hi>without Iſſue, &amp;c.</hi> theſe laſt words did not make a <hi>Tail General</hi> to the Deviſee: For an Implication of an Eſtate of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance ſhall never ride over an expreſs limitation of an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before; being 'tis ſaid here <hi>for want of ſuch Iſſue the Land ſhould remain,</hi> 'tis plainly meant, that it ſhould not before the <hi>Iſſue</hi> failed, and then the <hi>Iſſue</hi> muſt have it ſo long (for none elſe can,) and ſo 'tis an <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi>

                     <p>Again, <hi>Wild's Caſe,</hi> where Lands were Deviſed to <hi>A.</hi> for Life, <hi>Remainder</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> and the <hi>Heirs of his Body, Remainder</hi> to <hi>Wild</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and after their deceaſe <hi>to their Children.</hi> And the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> were at firſt divided: Indeed, it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards adjudged an <hi>Eſtate for Life</hi> to <hi>Wild</hi> and his Wife:</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was not, <hi>after their deceaſe to the Children of their Bodies;</hi> for then there would be an Eye of an <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The main <hi>Reaſon</hi> was, becauſe there were <hi>Children</hi> at the time of the <hi>Deviſe;</hi> and that was the only Reaſon the <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> went upon in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber.</hi> And tho' it be ſaid in the latter end of the Caſe, <hi>That if there were no Children at that time, every Child born after might take by Remainder;</hi> 'tis not ſaid poſitively that they <hi>ſhould take:</hi> And it ſeems to be in oppoſition to their <hi>taking</hi> preſently; but however that be, it comes not to this Caſe: For tho' the word <hi>Children</hi> may be made <hi>nomen collectivum,</hi> the word <hi>Iſſue</hi> is <hi>nomen collectivum</hi> of it ſelf. <hi>Hill. 42. and 43 Eliz.

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis objected, that in this Caſe the Limitation is expreſly <hi>for Life,</hi> and in that reſpect ſtronger than <hi>Wild's Caſe:</hi> And this is the great difficulty.</p>
                     <p>But I Anſwer:</p>
                     <p>That tho' theſe words do weigh the Intention that way, yet they are ballanced by an apparent Intention that weighs as much on the other ſide; which is, That as long as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſhould have <hi>Children,</hi> that the <hi>Land</hi> ſhould never go over to <hi>John;</hi> for there was as much reaſon to provide for the <hi>Iſſue of the Iſſue,</hi> as the firſt <hi>Iſſue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, A <hi>Tenant in Tail</hi> has to many purpoſes but an <hi>Eſtate for Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, 'Tis poſſible that he did intend him but an <hi>Eſtate for Life,</hi> and 'tis by conſequence and operation of Law only that it becomes an <hi>Eſtate Tail. 1651.

                     </p>
                     <p>Another Objection was, That there being a <hi>Power</hi> appointed to <hi>Bernard</hi> to make his Wife a <hi>Joynture,</hi> it ſhews, that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he ſhould have but an <hi>Eſtate for Life,</hi> which needed ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> and not an <hi>Eſtate Tail;</hi> for then he might have made a <hi>Joynture</hi> without it?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, If one be Acquitted in an Action of <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> the other cannot be Guilty: But where one is found Guilty, and the other comes not in upon <hi>Proceſs,</hi> or if he dies hanging the Suit; yet <hi>Judgment</hi> ſhall be upon the <hi>Verdict</hi> againſt the other.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wild</hi> ſaid, The difference was, where the Suit was upon <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> wherein the <hi>Villanous Judgment</hi> was to be given, and where the <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> is laid only by way of Aggravation, as in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, It would be the ſame in an Action againſt two upon the Caſe for <hi>Conſpiracy;</hi> but not in ſuch Actions, where tho' there be a Charge of <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> yet the <hi>Gift</hi> of the Action is upon another matter.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid, They would give him two or three days for the bringing in of the other two, and defer the Entry of the <hi>Judgment</hi> in the mean time.</p>

                     <p>THe Caſe was moved again by <hi>North Solicitor.</hi> He urgrd for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> That the <hi>Iſſue</hi> being, <hi>Whether they took the Felon upon Freſh Suit?</hi> It being not found that there was any actual <hi>Taking,</hi> or that the <hi>Freſh Suit</hi> continued until Sir <hi>J. Aſh</hi> found the Felon in the preſence of Sir <hi>P. Warwick.</hi> Alſo, it was found that Sir <hi>J. Aſh</hi> was a <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> and therefore it was his duty to Apprehend him.</p>
                     <p>To this it was Anſwered,</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Winton</hi> (upon which the Action is founded, and not upon the <hi>27</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and therefore it is ill if it concludes <hi>contra formam Statutorum</hi>) doth not ſay ſhall <hi>Take,</hi> but ſhall <hi>Anſwer</hi> the Bodies of the Offenders; which is, <hi>Anſwer them to Juſtice:</hi> And therefore if the <hi>Felon</hi> be taken upon another account, and the <hi>Country</hi> finding him in Priſon, cauſe him to be Indicted; this ſatisfies the <hi>Statute, Goldsb. 55.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, it was more decent for Sir <hi>John Aſh</hi> being concerned as an Inhabitant of the <hi>Hundred</hi> to leave this Matter to the other <hi>Juſtice of the Peace;</hi> (for it has been known, that <hi>Juſtices of the Peace</hi> have been Cenſured in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> for being too forward to interpoſe in their own buſineſs:) But if it were an omiſſion of the Duty of his Office, that could not be Objected to him as an Inhabitant, having done enough to ſatisfie the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Winton.</hi>

                        <hi>1.</hi> The Reſervation was good by the contract, tho' without <hi>Deed.</hi> And ſo it was adjudged in this <hi>Court</hi> in <hi>Manly's Caſe,</hi> that <hi>Tenant</hi> for years might aſſign his whole <hi>Term</hi> by <hi>Parol,</hi> rendring <hi>Rent;</hi> ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Purcas and Owen, 23 Car.</hi> But it was doubted, whether an <hi>Action</hi> would lye until the laſt day were paſt.

ſoon perſwaded her out of the <hi>Coach,</hi> and then pulls out a <hi>Maid ſervant</hi> there attending <hi>Mrs. Ramſy;</hi> and then gets himſelf into the <hi>Coach,</hi> and there detains her until the <hi>Coachman</hi> carried them to his <hi>Lodgings</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where the next Morning he prevails upon her, (having firſt threatned to carry her beyond <hi>Sea</hi> if ſhe refuſed) to Marry him, but was the ſame day apprehended in the ſame <hi>Houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a firſt doubted, whether the Evidence of <hi>Lucy Ramſy</hi> was to be admitted, becauſe ſhe was his <hi>Wife de facto,</hi> tho' not <hi>de jure.</hi> But the <hi>Court ſeriatim</hi> delivered their Opinions, that ſhe was to be admitted a <hi>Witneſs.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> For that there was one continuing force upon her, from the beginning till the <hi>Marriage;</hi> wherefore, whatſoever was done while ſhe was under that violence was not to be reſpected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As ſuch Caſes are generally contrived, ſo hainous a Crime, would go unpuiſhed, unleſs the Teſtimony of the <hi>Woman</hi> ſhould be received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In <hi>Fulwoods Caſe,</hi> reported in <hi>1 Cro.</hi> (which was read in the <hi>Court</hi>) the <hi>Woman</hi> was a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> tho' married as here; and <hi>Rainsford</hi> cited my <hi>Lord Caſtlehavens Caſe,</hi> where the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs</hi> gave Evidence, that he aſſiſted the committing a <hi>Rape</hi> upon her: But <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid he was not governed by that caſe, becauſe there was a <hi>Wife de jure,</hi> the Evidence being clear as to all the Points of the <hi>Statute, (viz.)</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>IN an <hi>Ejectment</hi> upon a <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> the Caſe was to this effect.</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Cooper Vicar of Granbrook in Kent,</hi> being ſeized of an <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> thereunto appertaining, parcel of the <hi>Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of his <hi>Vicaridge</hi> ſituate in a <hi>Market Town</hi> in the year <hi>1672<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> lets it for three years, and one year of the ſaid <hi>Leaſe</hi> being expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>11</hi> of <hi>Sept. 1673.</hi> lets it for <hi>21</hi> years, to begin from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, reſerving the <hi>Rent</hi> during the <hi>Term,</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the uſual <hi>Feaſts,</hi> or within ten days after; this <hi>Leaſe</hi> was confirmed by the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> (<hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>Vicarage</hi>) and <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:51792:129"/>Some years after <hi>Cooper</hi> dies, and the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether <hi>Buck</hi> (the ſucceeding Vicar) could avoid this Leaſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Point was, <hi>Whether the Leaſe became void within 80 Days after the death of <hi>Cooper,</hi> by the Statute of Non-reſidence?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">13 Eliz. 20.</note> And as to that all the <hi>Juſtices</hi> were of Opinion, that <hi>Death</hi> would not make ſuch a <hi>Non-reſidence</hi> as ſhould avoid the Leaſe; for the Intention of the <hi>Statute</hi> was, to oblige the <hi>Incumbents</hi> to <hi>Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By impoſing of the Forfeiture of a years Value of their <hi>Benefice,</hi> if they did not Reſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By making their Leaſes void; which tho' <hi>prima facie</hi> ſeemed to be to their advantage, yet was not ſo in the conſequence; for none would be induced to Farm their Lands, becauſe it was in their power to defeat their Leaſes by <hi>Non reſidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, 'Tis plain the <hi>Statute</hi> meant a <hi>Wilful Abſence,</hi> becauſe it ſays, <hi>The party ſo offending the Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> that allows Leaſes of Houſes, &amp;c. in Market Towns for 40 years,</hi> would be of no effect if <hi>Death</hi> ſhould be interpreted a <hi>Non-reſidence,</hi> and the Confirmation of <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Ordinary</hi> would be to no purpoſe. <hi>Butler and Goodale's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>6 Co. 21. b.</hi> is, that where the <hi>Incumbent</hi> is abſent upon an <hi>Inhibition,</hi> or for the ſake of his <hi>Health,</hi> he is not within the Penalty of that Law. There is only one ſingle <hi>Authority</hi> againſt this, <hi>
                           <hi>(viz.)</hi> Mott and Hale's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>1 Cro. 123.</hi> which <hi>Twiſden</hi> doubted, whether it were ſo adjudged, becauſe my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> mentions it no where, ſuppoſing ſo Notable a Point would not have eſcaped his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, eſpecially in a Caſe wherein he was Counſel. But <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, It was Adjudged by the Opinion of three <hi>Judges;</hi> tho' in <hi>Moor</hi> 'tis ſaid, the <hi>Court</hi> was Divided; but it was a hard <hi>Opinion:</hi> And in the <hi>38th</hi> of <hi>Eliz. B.R. Moor 609.</hi> the very Point was adjudged contrary.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Point, <hi>Whether it were void, becauſe the Rent was reſerved at the uſual Feaſts, or within Ten days after?</hi> For it was urged, that the <hi>Term</hi> ending at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> would be expired before the laſt Payment: And for the other payments, 'tis for the <hi>Succeſſor</hi>'s advantage, becauſe the <hi>Predeceſſor</hi> may dye within the Ten days. But the <hi>Court</hi> were clear of Opinion, in regard the <hi>Reſervation</hi> was during the <hi>Term,</hi> that there ſhould be no <hi>Ten days</hi> given to the <hi>Leſſee</hi> for the laſt payment, according to <hi>Barwicke and Foſter's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>2 Cro. 227, 233.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third point, <hi>Whether this were a Leaſe in Reverſion, and ſo not warranted by the Statute of the 14 of <hi>Elizabeth?</hi>
                        </hi> And all the <hi>Court</hi> held that it was. This <hi>Statute</hi> repeats that of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> as to <hi>Houſes</hi> in <hi>Market Towns,</hi> (which Liberty was given, as <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſaid, to render thoſe places more populous;) but excepts <hi>Leaſes</hi> in <hi>Reverſion,</hi> which this is, being to commence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51792:130"/>
at a Day to come, where a Power is annexed to an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life</hi> to make <hi>Leaſes in poſſeſſion.</hi> A man cannot make a Leaſe to commence <hi>in futuro.</hi> In the <hi>6 Co. Fitz William's Caſe, 4 E. 3. tit. Waſte 18.</hi> the <hi>Leſſor</hi> made a Leaſe to commence after the death of the <hi>Tenant for Life,</hi> and notwithſtanding maintained an Action of <hi>Waſte:</hi> And <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> citing that Caſe, diſtinguiſhes between a <hi>Grant of the Reverſion,</hi> and a <hi>Leaſe in Reverſion,</hi> as that Caſe was. In <hi>Plowden's Commentaries, Tracy's Caſe,</hi> A Leaſe made to commence at a Day to come, is given as a moſt proper Inſtance of a <hi>Leaſe in Reverſion.</hi> In the <hi>1 Cro. 546. Hunt and Singleton's Caſe,</hi> a Leaſe of an <hi>Houſe</hi> for <hi>40</hi> years (there being <hi>10</hi> years unexpired of a former Leaſe) by the <hi>Dean and Chapter</hi> of <hi>St. Pauls,</hi> was held not warranted by the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> The like was Reſolved in <hi>C. B. 14 Car. 2.</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Wyn</hi> and <hi>Wild,</hi> of a Leaſe of the <hi>Dean and Chapter</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there the <hi>Court</hi> denied the Opinion in <hi>Tomſon and Trafford's Caſe, Poph. 9.</hi> And two of the <hi>Judges</hi> ſeemed to be of Opinion, (and <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſtrongly), that if the Leaſe in the Caſe at Bar had been made to commence preſently, it yet would have been void, there being another Leaſe in being; ſo that for ſo many years as were to come of the former Leaſe, it would be a Leaſe in <hi>Reverſion:</hi> And that the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> that permits a concurrent Leaſe, ſo that there be not above three years in being, ſhall not in their Opinion, make any alteration of the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> but it only extends to the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> becauſe it recites that, but not the former. And ſo is the Opinion of <hi>Hobart,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Crane and Taylour 269.</hi> and it hath been often held, that it does not extend to the Statute of <hi>1 Eliz.</hi> concerning <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But of this <hi>Hale</hi> doubted, and rather conceived the contrary <hi>(viz.) That the Leaſe had been good, if it had been made to commence preſently, there being leſs than three years to come of the former Leaſe.</hi> And that of the <hi>18</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> did give a qualification to Leaſes made upon the <hi>14th,</hi> as well as the <hi>13th.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>14</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> is a kind of an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and does not repeat it, but <hi>ſub modo</hi> a little enlarging it as to <hi>Houſes</hi> in <hi>Market Towns:</hi> Wherefore the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> reciting the <hi>13th,</hi> does by conſequence recite the <hi>14th</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is ſuch a Connexion betwixt all the <hi>Statutes,</hi> concerning Leaſes of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical perſons,</hi> that they have been taken into the Conſtruction of one another. The <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>32d</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> is not recited, neither in the <hi>1ſt</hi> or the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> yet a Leaſe is not warranted upon thoſe <hi>Statutes,</hi> unleſs it hath the Qualifications required by the <hi>32d</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> And this courſe is uſual in the Conſtruction of <hi>Statutes</hi> made <hi>in pari materia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:51792:130"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It would make a great <hi>Romage</hi> in Leaſes, as he conceived, if a Leaſe ſhould be void, when there was never ſo little of a former Leaſe unexpired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is no <hi>Authority</hi> to the contrary. In <hi>Hunt</hi> and <hi>Singleton's Caſe</hi> there was <hi>10</hi> years of the former Leaſe in being, and upon that lay the weight of the <hi>Opinion.</hi> And <hi>Crane</hi> and <hi>Taylor's Caſe</hi> is concerning <hi>Covenants</hi> only; and the Reaſon that it doth not extend to the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> begins with <hi>Inferiour Eccleſiaſtical perſons,</hi> and therefore cannot include <hi>Biſhops.</hi>

Such an one <hi>Danbert</hi> got, and gave Notice to the <hi>Captain,</hi> at what time he ſhould be carried from the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to <hi>Ludgate</hi> thereby. Before this time the <hi>Captain</hi> commanded this <hi>Serjeant</hi> to take twenty or thirty <hi>Soldiers</hi> with him, and Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and Reſcue him from the <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Counter,</hi> as they were bringing him along. Accordingly the <hi>Serjeant</hi> and <hi>Soldiers</hi> went, and lay in or near an <hi>Alehouſe</hi> about <hi>Popes-head Alley</hi> in Ambuſcade till the <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſhould be brought by: And when they had Notice from one (who they had placed as <hi>Centinel</hi>) that he was coming, they ſallied out and drew their <hi>Swords;</hi> (for the <hi>Serjeant</hi> had given them order ſo to do, and if any oppoſition were made they ſhould kill the firſt Man:) And by this means they Reſcued him and carried him away.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon Complaint being made to the <hi>Captain;</hi> He Anſwered, <hi>That his Soldiers had done well, and he would Juſtifie it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> asked him, what he had to ſay in his Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>He ſaid, <hi>That he did not know the Law; but he ever thought that a Soldier could not be Arreſted without leave of his Officer; and that there was an Agreement to that purpoſe, between the late Lord General and the former Lord Chief Juſtice, and that he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51792:132"/>
knew one that had done the like thing, and nothing was ſaid to him for it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale Chief Juſtice,</hi> (to whom the reſt agreed) ſaid, The more wrong has been done. It ſeems you are grown very Dead-ſtrong; but you ought to know, that every <hi>Officer</hi> and <hi>Soldier</hi> is as liable to be Arreſted, as a <hi>Tradeſman</hi> or any other perſon whatſoever; and you ought to give full Obedience to the <hi>King</hi>'s Commands; ſignified by his <hi>Writs</hi> or <hi>Proceſs.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Wild</hi> ſaid, That that may be ſerved upon you, when you are in the Head of your <hi>Company.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid further. You are the <hi>Kings Servants,</hi> and intended for his Defence againſt his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and to preſerve the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> not to exempt your ſelf from the Authority of the <hi>Laws.</hi> And indeed it were a vain thing to talk of <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> if <hi>Military Men</hi> ſhall thus give the <hi>Law,</hi> and controll <hi>Proceedings:</hi> And for that <hi>Agreement</hi> you ſpeak of, I know nothing of it; and if there were any ſuch thing, it could be nothing but a <hi>Civility.</hi> Whatever you <hi>Military Men</hi> think, you ſhall find that you are under the <hi>Civil Juriſdiction,</hi> and you but gnaw a <hi>File,</hi> you will break your <hi>Teeth</hi> e're you ſhall prevail againſt it. This is an Outragious <hi>Offence,</hi> and the Puniſhment has formerly gone high. Men have heretofore loſt their <hi>Heads</hi> for Matters of ſuch nature; and one of the <hi>Crimes</hi> of the late <hi>London Apprentices</hi> was the breaking of <hi>Priſons,</hi> and delivering of <hi>Priſoners;</hi> for which they had Iudgment of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> by the Advice of all the <hi>Judges.</hi> The <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Serjeant</hi> were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate:</hi> and being brought up at another time, <hi>Hale</hi> asked, Why an <hi>Information</hi> againſt theſe Perſons was not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited? And told the <hi>City Counſel,</hi> that if the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> did not proſecute this buſineſs, they (the <hi>Court</hi>) would Proſecute them; for this was a matter of great Example, and ought not to be ſmothered: And further ſaid, If that Men will take upon them to Reſcue all <hi>Soldiers</hi> that are Committed, it may be within the reach of <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> becauſe of the Vniverſality of the Deſign againſt the <hi>King's Athority:</hi> But this being but for one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it cannot be <hi>Treaſon;</hi> but 'tis a rank <hi>Miſdemeanour.</hi> And be Ordered, that as many of the reſt of the <hi>Soldiers</hi> ſhould be Proſecuted as their Names could be learned. There muſt be one more to make a <hi>Riot,</hi> tho' however 'tis a <hi>Miſdemeanour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wild</hi> ſaid, Tho' they cannot find out another Name; yet if it be ſet forth, and made out that there were others, 'tis enough to make a <hi>Riot.</hi>

                     <p>It was argued for the <hi>Executor,</hi> that this <hi>Rent</hi> is meerly due by the <hi>Contract,</hi> and not incident to the <hi>Reverſion,</hi> and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator</hi> is in <hi>Paramount,</hi> it being now as if the <hi>Teſtator</hi> had died <hi>Inteſtate;</hi> and therefore, before the <hi>Statute</hi> of this <hi>King,</hi> ſuch <hi>Adminiſtrators</hi> could not have had a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a <hi>Judgment</hi> obtained by the <hi>Executor;</hi> tho' in the Caſe of <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Vere, 3 Cro. 450, 457.</hi> 'tis held, that he may have a <hi>Liberate</hi> where the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor</hi> had proceeded in the <hi>Execution</hi> of a <hi>Statute,</hi> ſo far as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for there the thing is executed, and not meerly <hi>Executory</hi> as a <hi>Judgment.</hi> If a Man that hath a <hi>Term</hi> in the right of his <hi>Wife,</hi> lets part of it, reſerving a <hi>Rent,</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> ſurviving ſhall not not have the <hi>Rent:</hi> On the other ſide it was ſaid, that this caſe differed from that, becauſe the Reſervation here is by him, that had the whole <hi>Right</hi> executed in him.</p>
                     <p>Another objection againſt the <hi>Action</hi> was, that here in the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> being in <hi>Covenant</hi> for <hi>Non payment</hi> of <hi>Rent,</hi> there is not any demand alledged. But that was anſwered, becauſe the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> was to pay ſuch a Sum for the <hi>Rent</hi> expreſly; but if the <hi>Condition</hi> of a <hi>Bond</hi> be for performance of <hi>Covenants</hi> expreſſed in ſuch a <hi>Leaſe,</hi> one of which is for payment of <hi>Rent,</hi> in that caſe the <hi>Bond</hi> will not be forfeit without a demand; and of that Opinion were the <hi>Court,</hi> and that the <hi>Executor</hi> ſhould have
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51792:137"/>
the <hi>Rent,</hi> but when recovered <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, it ſhould be Aſſets in his Hands. And accordingly Iudgment was given for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>

under the benefit of the <hi>Strangers Contract.</hi> And <hi>Hale</hi> reſembled it to the Caſe of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Tenant</hi> by an entire <hi>Service,</hi> if ſuch <hi>Tenant</hi> aliens part, the <hi>Service</hi> is multiplied; and after it be conveyed to the <hi>Lord,</hi> the entire <hi>Service</hi> ſtill remains upon the <hi>Tenant</hi> that holds the reſidue.

And the Caſe of <hi>Dorrell and Andrews, Rolls tit. Extinguiſhment 938.</hi> is full in the Point, That where <hi>Leſſee for years</hi> letts at Will, which <hi>Leſſee</hi> Licenſes the <hi>Leſſor</hi> to enter, that the Entry of the <hi>Leſſor</hi> thereupon ſhall not ſuſpend his <hi>Rent.</hi> For <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, Tho' it might be Objected, that in regard the <hi>Leſſee</hi> at <hi>Will</hi> cannot lett, the Entry of the <hi>Leſſor</hi> thereupon might be a <hi>Diſſeiſin;</hi> but that is ever at the Election of the <hi>Leſſor:</hi> And if that were now the Queſtion, perhaps the <hi>Leſſor</hi> cannot take ſuch an <hi>Entry</hi> for a <hi>Deſſeiſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the Common Experience, that where it comes to be tryed upon <hi>Nil debet,</hi> if it be ſhewn that the <hi>Leſſor</hi> entred into part to Anſwer this, by proving it was the Leaſe of the <hi>Leſſee;</hi> and if the <hi>Law</hi> ſhould not go upon this difference, it would ſhake abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Rents,</hi> it being a frequent thing for a <hi>Leſſor</hi> to Hire a Room, or other part of the thing demiſed, for his Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.</p>

                     <p>IN an <hi>Ejectment</hi> upon a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> the Caſe was to this effect:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in the . . of <hi>Eliz.</hi> levied a <hi>Fine</hi> of the Lands in queſtion to the uſe of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Pembrook</hi> and his Heirs, for payment of his <hi>Debts,</hi> reſerving a Power to himſelf to Revoke by any <hi>Writing Indented,</hi> or by his laſt <hi>Will,</hi> ſubſcribed with his Hand and ſealed with his Seal: And ſometime after he Covenants by a <hi>Writing</hi> (Sealed and Subſcribed, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) to Levy a <hi>Fine</hi> to other uſes, and after the <hi>Covenant</hi> a <hi>Fine</hi> was levied accordingly. And whether this ſhould be taken as a <hi>Revocation,</hi> and ſo an execution of the <hi>Power,</hi> and the extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, was the Queſtion?</p>
                     <p>It was Argued by <hi>Jones, Attorney General,</hi> that this ſhould not be taken as a <hi>Revocation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:51792:146"/>In <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Revocation,</hi> there is to be conſidered the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and the <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> and that which Revokes muſt be defective in neither. The <hi>Deed</hi> alone in this Caſe cannot revoke; for tho' it has the <hi>Circumſtance</hi> limited <hi>(viz.) Indenting, Writing, Sealing, Subſcribing;</hi> yet it wants <hi>Subſtance,</hi> for it doth nothing <hi>in praeſenti,</hi> but refers to a future Act <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Fine.</hi> If a man has made his <hi>Will,</hi> a <hi>Covenant</hi> after that he will levy a <hi>Fine,</hi> or a <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Feoffment</hi> made, will not be a <hi>Revocation</hi> of the <hi>Will, 1 Roll. 615.</hi> yet there appeared an intention to Revoke; and leſs matter will Revoke a <hi>Will</hi> than a <hi>Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the <hi>Fine</hi> alone cannot Revoke, becauſe it is defective in the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> contained in the <hi>Power;</hi> but then to conſider them both together, how can it be conceived that the <hi>Fine</hi> ſhould communicate <hi>Subſtance</hi> to the <hi>Deed,</hi> or the <hi>Deed</hi> give <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> to the <hi>Fine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 'tis Objected, <hi>That they make but one Conveyance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, If ſo, then the words of the <hi>Power</hi> here are to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke by Deed,</hi> and not <hi>by Deed and Fine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, This Conſtruction is repugnant to the words of the <hi>Power,</hi> which are, <hi>That it ſhall be lawful for him to Revoke by his Deed:</hi> And yet it is agreed here, that the <hi>Deed</hi> of it ſelf is not ſufficient to revoke, but only in reſpect of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act done, which (as it muſt be obſerved) is executed at another time. The Books agree, that a <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Power, &amp;c.</hi> may be annexed to an Eſtate by a diſtinct <hi>Deed</hi> from that which conveys the Eſtate; but not unleſs both are Sealed and Delivered at the ſame time, and ſo they are but as one <hi>Deed:</hi> But in the preſent Caſe, the <hi>Deed</hi> was made in one year, and the <hi>Fine</hi> levied in another. Suppoſe the <hi>Power</hi> to be with ſuch <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> as in our Caſe, and a <hi>Deed</hi> is made which contains ſome of them at one time, and another <hi>Deed</hi> comprehending the reſt of another time, Should both theſe make a <hi>Revocation</hi> is one Deed? Surely not.</p>

It was there Reſolved, that a Deviſe of the Lands by <hi>Will</hi> (with all the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> limited in the <hi>Power</hi>) ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke; yet the <hi>Delivery</hi> was one of the <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and the <hi>Uſes</hi> were to ceaſe then and from thenceforth: Whereas a <hi>Will</hi> which could have not effect while his Death, did ſtrongly import, that the meaning was to do it by <hi>Deed,</hi> and yet there the <hi>Will</hi> alone could be no <hi>Revocation;</hi> for clearly he might have made another <hi>Will</hi> after, and ſo required other Matter, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his <hi>Death</hi> to compleat it. And in that Caſe there is another put, That if a Deed of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> had been made, and the party had declared, it ſhould not take place until <hi>100 l</hi> paid, there the operation of it would have been in ſuſpence until the <hi>100 l</hi> paid, and then it would have been ſufficient; yet there it had been done by ſeveral Acts, and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Natures, the <hi>Intention</hi> in things of this nature, mainly governs the <hi>Conſtruction.</hi> In <hi>Terries Caſe</hi> it was Ruled, That if <hi>A.</hi> makes a <hi>Leaſe for years</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> and then Levies a <hi>Fine</hi> to him, to the end that he might be <hi>Tenant</hi> to the <hi>Praecipe</hi> for the ſuffering of a <hi>Recovery,</hi> that after the <hi>Recovery</hi> ſuffered his <hi>Leaſe</hi> ſhould revive. 'Tis true in the Caſe at <hi>Bar,</hi> if the <hi>Fine</hi> had been levied firſt, and then the Deed of <hi>Uſes</hi> made afterwards, the <hi>Power</hi> had been extinguiſhed by the <hi>Fine,</hi> and ſo no <hi>Revocation</hi> (of that which had no being) could have been by the <hi>Deed.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale.</hi> I doubt whether that would have helped it. I cannot ſubmit to the Opinion in <hi>Parker and Ingrams Caſe</hi> cited, <hi>
                           <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Deed not being Enrolled, ſhould make no Revocation.</hi> For in caſe of a Power to make <hi>Leaſes for life,</hi> it has been always held (by the beſt Advice) that the better way is to do it by <hi>Deed</hi> without <hi>Livery,</hi> (tho' <hi>Livery,</hi> by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> is incident to a <hi>Leaſe for life</hi>) and ſo Adjudged in <hi>Rogers's Caſe,</hi> for Lands in <hi>Blandford forum</hi> in <hi>Moor's Rep.</hi> where <hi>Tenant for life</hi> hath power to make <hi>Leaſes for life,</hi> and makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> by <hi>Livery,</hi> 'tis there held a <hi>Forfeiture;</hi> tho' I conceived not, becauſe by the <hi>Deed</hi> the <hi>Leaſe</hi> takes effect, and ſo the <hi>Livery</hi> comes too late. Therefore the omiſſion of Enrolling the <hi>Deed</hi> (in that caſe) does not ſeem to be material; but if that Opinion be to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it is, becauſe the party had ſuch an <hi>Intereſt,</hi> upon which the <hi>Deed</hi> might enure without Execution of his <hi>Power,</hi> and ſo rather conſtrued to work upon his <hi>Intereſt.</hi> But that <hi>Reaſon</hi> does not ſatisfie, becauſe ſuch an Eſtate as was intended to be conveyed, could not be derived out of his <hi>Intereſt;</hi> therefore it ſhould take effect by his <hi>Power,</hi> according to <hi>Clere's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>6 Co.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So by the whole <hi>Court</hi> here, the <hi>Deed</hi> and <hi>Fine</hi> (taken together) were Reſolved to be a good Execution of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> given accordingly.</p>

Poſſeſſions, Rights, Hereditaments of what nature ſoever; Intereſts, which does as well ſignifie the Eſtate in the ting, as that wherein the Eſtate is, which can have no effect if not extended to Eſtates Tail.</hi> We muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo, that at the making of this <hi>Act,</hi> entailed <hi>Lands</hi> were not protected from Forfeitures; and tho' <hi>26 H. 8.</hi> extends only to Caſes, where the Offender is attainted; yet 'tis of good direction to the <hi>Judges</hi> in Caſes of like nature, and 'tis plain, that by this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>13 Car. 2.</hi> the Offenders were looked upon in <hi>pari gradu</hi> with theſe attainted; for when the <hi>Proviſo</hi> comes to ſave the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Strangers, &amp;c.</hi> in truſt for whom the Offenders were ſeized, It is ſaid notwithſtanding any of the <hi>Convictions</hi> or <hi>Attainders</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is to be obſerved, that the <hi>Act</hi> takes notice, that divers of the Offenders included in this <hi>Act</hi> were dead; now in regard moſt <hi>Lands</hi> are known to be entailed, if the <hi>Act</hi> had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſuch <hi>Eſtates</hi> to be forfeited, it would ſignifie nothing indeed, if the Offenders had been alive it might have been ſomewhat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Forfeiture during their Lives; But as the caſe was, it ſhould be of no effect at all after making a great noiſe of Forfeitures and Confiſcations, the <hi>Act</hi> would have been but a <hi>Gun</hi> charged only with <hi>Powder,</hi> or as in the <hi>Fable, Parturiunt Montes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is manifeſt, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> did not intend that the <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Perſons</hi> within the <hi>Penalties</hi> of the <hi>Act,</hi> ſhould have any benefit of their <hi>Eſtates;</hi> for in the ſaving which is made for <hi>Purchaſers</hi> upon valuable Conſiderations, the <hi>Wives Children and Heirs</hi> of the Offenders are excepted; then ſurely if they would bar them of the benefit of their <hi>Purchaſes, à fortiori</hi> from inheriting to an <hi>Eſtate Tail,</hi> eſpecially of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Entail,</hi> that ſeems to be made with a proſpect of this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> which was perpetrated a year after, and ſuch an <hi>Entail</hi> as ſcarce the like was ever ſeen before; that a power ſhould be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51792:152"/>
to make <hi>Leaſes</hi> for any number of years, and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of any <hi>Rent.</hi> By which it is manifeſt, that <hi>Sir John Danvers</hi> that committed the <hi>Treaſon,</hi> was fully <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Eſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> all <hi>Conveyances</hi> are avoided by the <hi>Act,</hi> unleſs ſuch as were upon valuable <hi>Conſideration;</hi> which this <hi>Fine</hi> was not. The great caſe which has been inſiſted upon by way of objection, is <hi>Trudgeons Caſe, Co. Litt. 130. Eſtates Tail</hi> were not forfeited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> but during the Offenders <hi>Life.</hi> For anſwer to that it muſt be obſerved, that, that Forfeiture is upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>16 R. 2.</hi> at which times <hi>Eſtates Tail</hi> were under thè protection of the <hi>Statute de donis;</hi> but ſince that time the <hi>Judges</hi> have not been ſo ſtrict in expounding <hi>Statutes</hi> concerning <hi>Eſtates Tail,</hi> as appears by <hi>Adams and Lamberts Caſe, 4 Co.</hi> That an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> given for a ſuperſtitious uſe, was within the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>1 E. 6. cap. 4.</hi> where the words are generally, and not ſo large as in our caſe, nor ſo much to demonſtrate the intent as is in our <hi>Act</hi> to extend to <hi>Eſtates Tail,</hi> wherefore Iudgment was given for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> They that argued for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> endeavoured to maintain, that if it ſhould be admitted, that <hi>Entails</hi> were not forfeited by the <hi>Act;</hi> yet the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of <hi>Sir John Danvers,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Lands</hi> would be forfeited, in regard he levied a <hi>Fine</hi> in <hi>1647,</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>13 Car. 2.</hi> extends to all <hi>Lands, &amp;c.</hi> whereof the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therein mentioned were ſeized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince <hi>1646,</hi> and he being <hi>Tenant in Tail</hi> and levying of a <hi>Fine,</hi> there is an <hi>Inſtantaneous Fee</hi> in him, out of which the new <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> is ſuppoſed to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and that cannot hold, bring derived out of a <hi>Fee</hi> ſubject to the Forfeiture by Relation; but this Point was not touched by the <hi>Judges,</hi> for that they were fully agreed upon the other Point.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>UPon a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> the Caſe appeared to be to this effect:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> poſſeſſed of a <hi>Term</hi> makes <hi>B. Executor,</hi> who makes three <hi>Executors,</hi> and dies; two of them dies, and the Will of <hi>B.</hi> the <hi>Executor</hi> not being diſcovered, <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> is granted <hi>cum Teſtamento annexo</hi> to <hi>D.</hi> who grants over the <hi>Term.</hi> The ſurviving <hi>Execcutor</hi> never intermeddles; but ſo ſoon as he had Notice of the <hi>Will,</hi> Refuſed before the Ordinary; and the Point was, Whether the grant of the <hi>Term</hi> in the mean time was good?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saunders</hi> (to maintain it) Argued, That to the making of an <hi>Executor,</hi> beſides the <hi>Will</hi> there was requiſite, that the <hi>Executor</hi> ſhould aſſent; and if the <hi>Executor</hi> refuſes, 'tis as much as if there never had been any. There is no <hi>Book</hi> which proves the Acts of an <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> void, where there is a <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Executor</hi> renounces. <hi>Greysbrook and Foxe's Caſe</hi> in <hi>Plowden's Com.</hi> is, that after <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> granted, the <hi>Executor</hi> proved the <hi>Will.</hi> And ſo in <hi>7 E. 4. 14.</hi> in <hi>Dormer and Clerke's Caſe,</hi> it was held, that where there was an <hi>Executor,</hi> who after refuſed, and <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> committed, the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> ſhould have all the <hi>Rent,</hi> (belonging to the <hi>Term</hi> in Reverſion) which accrued after the death of the <hi>Teſtator.</hi> If an <hi>Executor</hi> be a <hi>Debtor,</hi> and refuſes, the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> may Sue him: (Which was denied by <hi>Twiſden,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Perſonal Action</hi> once ſuſpended, is ever ſo.) <hi>Dyer 372.</hi> If one makes an <hi>Executor,</hi> who dies, and never proves the <hi>Will, Adminiſtration</hi> ſhall be granted, as upon a dying <hi>Inteſtate;</hi> ſuppoſe an <hi>Executor de ſon tort</hi> had <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt him, Shall not there be <hi>Execution</hi> upon a <hi>Term,</hi> as <hi>Aſſets</hi> in his hands?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twiſden.</hi> It hath been Doubted, whether there could be an <hi>Executor de ſon tort</hi> of a <hi>Term?</hi> or, whether he were not a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor?</hi> And by the ſame Reaſon it may be granted in the preſent Caſe; for at leaſt the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> here, is an <hi>Executor de ſon tort</hi> before the Refuſal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Levins contra.</hi> Anciently, <hi>Bona Inteſtati capi ſolebant in manus Regis;</hi> as appears in <hi>Henſloe's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>9 Co.</hi> And ſince the Power of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> hath been introduced, it was only to grant <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> upon a dying <hi>Inteſtate. 4 H. 7. Pl. 10.</hi> If the <hi>Ordinary</hi> cites the <hi>Executor</hi> to prove the <hi>Will,</hi> and he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51792:154"/>
'tis ſaid he may grant <hi>Adminiſtration;</hi> which implies, that it cannot be before. So <hi>21 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> is to grant <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, &amp;c.</hi> upon a dying <hi>Inteſtate,</hi> or refuſal of the <hi>Executor,</hi> the Intereſt of the <hi>Executor</hi> commences before the <hi>Probat.</hi> In <hi>36 H. 6. 8.</hi> an <hi>Executor</hi> commanded one to take the <hi>Goods,</hi> and after the Executor refuſed before the Ordinary, who committed <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> and the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> Sued the perſon that took the <hi>Goods;</hi> who Iuſtified by the <hi>Executor</hi>'s Command, and it was held good: And a <hi>Relation</hi> ſhall never make an Act good, which was void for defect of <hi>Power.</hi> And the <hi>Court</hi> ſeemed ſtrongly of that Opinion.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Serjeant Pemberton</hi> deſiring to Argue it, the <hi>Court</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to ſpeak to it the next <hi>Term. Et ſic Adjornatur.</hi>

                     <p>Father <hi>Tenant for Life,</hi> Remainder to the <hi>Son</hi> for Life, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to <hi>firſt Son</hi> of that <hi>Son</hi> (who was not born,) Remainder to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Body of the <hi>Father;</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> died before the <hi>firſt Son</hi> was born, and <hi>Whether the Deſcent of the Entail to the Son did prevent the Contingent Remainder,</hi> was the Queſtion?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Curia.</hi> In regard it was taken by <hi>Pirates,</hi> it is originally within the <hi>Admiral Juriſdiction,</hi> and ſo continues notwithſtanding the Sale afterwards upon the Land.

                     <p>IN an <hi>Ejectment,</hi> upon a <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> the Caſe appeared to be thus:</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That it was,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was Argued that after the <hi>Mandate</hi> made, it was Executed ſo far as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had to intermeddle in the matter. For if no <hi>Induction</hi> does follow, the Remedy lies not againſt the Biſhop, <hi>F.N.B. 47. h.</hi> But an <hi>Action upon the Caſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> for the <hi>Induction,</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>Temporal Act, 1 Rolls 125, 195.</hi> Neither can ſuch <hi>Mandate</hi> be Revoked by the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the <hi>King, 1 Rolls 294.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> hath a concurrent <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> with the <hi>Biſhops</hi> throughout his <hi>Province,</hi> and may <hi>Admit</hi> and <hi>Inſtitute</hi> until the <hi>Inferiour Biſhoprick</hi> is full.

                     </p>
                     <p>It was ſaid on the other ſide, That this was but an <hi>Authority</hi> derived from the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and therefore ceaſing before it was Executed, is determined. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> may direct his <hi>Mandate</hi> to another, as well as the <hi>Archdeacon.</hi> It was compared to a <hi>Letter of Attorney,</hi> to make <hi>Livery,</hi> which cannot be done after the Death of him that gave it. <hi>Et Adjornatur.

                     <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> Point the <hi>Court</hi> held, that if the <hi>Bailiff</hi> had no Authority to make <hi>Coniſans,</hi> it ought to be ſhewn on the <hi>Avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> part, for otherwiſe it ſhall be intended; and this may be Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed by the <hi>Avowant</hi> here, tho' the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in <hi>Replevin</hi> when <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizans</hi> is made cannot <hi>Traverſe</hi> the being <hi>Bailiff.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> Demurred: For altho' ſuch Action will lye, if there has been a <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt the <hi>Executor,</hi> yet no ſuch Action has been upon a <hi>Bond;</hi> and 'tis hard upon ſuch a Surmize to Charge the <hi>Executor</hi> in his own Right.</p>

                        <hi>ERror</hi> out of the <hi>Grand Seſſions</hi> of <hi>Wales:</hi> The Caſe upon a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> was thus;</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Deviſe</hi> to one and to the <hi>Heirs Males</hi> of his Body, with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That if he does attempt to Alien, then immediately his Eſtate ſhall ceaſe, and another ſhall Enter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Deviſee in Tail</hi> made a <hi>Feoffment,</hi> and he in <hi>Remainder</hi> Entred, and <hi>Judgment</hi> was given in the <hi>Grand Seſſions</hi> for the <hi>Feoffee</hi> againſt him in the <hi>Remainder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Errors</hi> were aſſigned in the Matter in Law: And to maintain the <hi>Errors</hi> it was ſaid, That it muſt be agreed of all hands, that a <hi>Tenant in Tail</hi> could not be reſtrained from Alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Recovery;</hi> and alſo, that in this Caſe a bare Attempt would be no breach, according to <hi>Corbett's and Sir A.

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:51792:163"/>
and would make a <hi>Diſcontinuance;</hi> and here this <hi>Proviſo</hi> imports as much, and therefore the <hi>Feoffment</hi> will be a breach; for that is an Attempt and more. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In <hi>Conveyances,</hi> the Intention of the words of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> and the Subſtance is regarded, and the Form of the words not ſo preciſely followed. As a <hi>Feoffment</hi> upon Condition, <hi>That the Feoffee ſhall give the Land in Frank marriage with the Daughter of the Feoffor:</hi> This cannot be ſtrictly purſued; yet the <hi>Feoffee</hi> muſt make a <hi>Gift</hi> as near as may be, <hi>Co. 1 Inſt. 217.</hi> So upon Condition <hi>to give the Land to a Layman in Frankalmoign:</hi> But this Rule holds (eſpecially in <hi>Wills</hi>) where the Intent is chiefly looked at. A <hi>Deviſe</hi> of all his <hi>Rents</hi> will paſs <hi>Reverſions</hi> upon <hi>Leaſes,</hi> and tho' the words be here, <hi>Proviſo if he does attempt to alien;</hi> 'tis as much as to ſay, <hi>Proviſo, if he doth alien, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the <hi>Feoffment</hi> ſhall determine the Eſtate <hi>quaſi</hi> by Limitation, ſo that the Remainder man ſhall take immediately by <hi>Executory Deviſe,</hi> and that is very clear. For tho' in <hi>M. Portington's Caſe</hi> in <hi>10 Co.</hi> 'tis ſaid, that the word <hi>Condition</hi> ſhall not in a <hi>Will</hi> be taken as a <hi>Limitation;</hi> yet the Current of the Authorities ſince are otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>But here the <hi>Court</hi> held the <hi>Condition</hi> void; for a man cannot be reſtrained from an Attempt to Alien: For <hi>non conſtat,</hi> what ſhall be judged an Attempt, and how can it be tryed? And when the expreſs words are ſo, there ſhall not be made another ſort of <hi>Condition</hi> than the <hi>Will</hi> imports. And ſo the <hi>Judgment</hi> was affirmed.</p>

Thoſe Lands which my Son <hi>J.</hi> ſhould have had, my meaning is, my Grandſon <hi>J.</hi> ſhall have.</hi> And in the <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf there is a Legacy deviſed to the Grandſon by that Name; ſo where they are ſo diſtinguiſhed, 'tis impoſſible to take the <hi>Grandſon</hi> to be meant by the name of <hi>Son.</hi> As to <hi>Beckford's Caſe,</hi> the Words are full to carry all, and therefore it had been impertinent to have wrote over the <hi>Will</hi> again.

                     <p>Vpon this Return it was moved for Mr. <hi>Pepis,</hi> that altho' they had alledged a Power to Chuſe a <hi>Recorder</hi> at Will, yet they ſhould have ſhewn Cauſe for his Removal, being a <hi>Judicial Office,</hi> which the <hi>Court</hi> takes notice of; and that none had ſuch a Power, but the <hi>King,</hi> to remove <hi>Judges ad libitum.</hi>

cited a Caſe of <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years, <hi>Remainder</hi> for <hi>Life, Remainder</hi> in <hi>Fee</hi> to a <hi>Stranger,</hi> he that had the <hi>Fee</hi> enfeoffed the Tenant for years by <hi>Deed</hi> and made <hi>Livery;</hi> and the <hi>Conveyance</hi> held void, for it could not work by <hi>Livery</hi> to the Tenant for years, who was in Poſſeſſion before; and a <hi>Surrender</hi> it could not be, becauſe of the intermediate <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life;</hi> and it could not work as a <hi>Grant</hi> for want of Attornment.

                     <p>It was firſt inſiſted on, that <hi>Enrollment</hi> of the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> tho' to paſs <hi>Lands,</hi> was not neceſſary, <hi>2 Co. 26.</hi> But that the <hi>Court</hi> overruled, ſaying, that <hi>Enrolment</hi> is not requiſite upon an <hi>Aſſignment</hi> of <hi>Goods,</hi> but of <hi>Lands</hi> it is: But then it was ſaid, that after the <hi>Deed</hi> was <hi>Enrolled</hi> it ſhall relate to the <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;</hi> and it was compared to a <hi>Bargain</hi> and <hi>Sale,</hi> where by the <hi>Statute of H. 8.</hi> of <hi>Enrolments,</hi> nothing paſſeth till the <hi>Deed</hi> be <hi>Enrolled;</hi> but then it relates <hi>2 Inſtit. 675, Bargainee</hi> ſells before <hi>Enrolment,</hi> the ſubſequent <hi>Enrolment</hi> makes it good; ſo if the <hi>Bargainee</hi> ſuffers a <hi>Recovery</hi> before <hi>Enrolment,</hi> he is a good <hi>Tenant</hi> to the <hi>Praecipe,</hi> by relation, <hi>ibidem:</hi> And this is confirmed by the common practice.

                     <p>IN an <hi>Indebitat' Aſſumpſit</hi> by an <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> upon <hi>Non aſſumpſit</hi> a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> was found, upon which the Caſe appeared to be thus:</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Staly</hi> was Arreſted by an <hi>Executor</hi> of his <hi>Creditor, 6 Sept</hi> which was before <hi>Probat</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and within two or three days after he paid <hi>1000 l</hi> to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> to whom he ſtood Indebted in ſuch Sum, and after the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> he yielded himſelf to Priſon upon the ſaid Arreſt.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the Defendant ſhould be obliged to Refund this Money which was paid unto him, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether the Arreſt before the <hi>Probat</hi> was a good Arreſt? It was ſaid, If an <hi>Executor</hi> hath a Reverſion in a Term upon which a <hi>Rent</hi> is reſerved, and <hi>Diſtrains, &amp;c.</hi> he may avow for the <hi>Rent</hi> before the <hi>Probat. Vid. 1 Roll. 917. tit. Executors,</hi> where an <hi>Executor</hi> brings an Action before <hi>Probat;</hi> yet if he ſhews the <hi>Probat</hi> upon the <hi>Declaration</hi> 'tis well enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether, when he yields himſelf to Priſon, it ſhall not relate to the firſt Arreſt, to make him a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> from that time? This depends upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>21 Jac. cap. 19.</hi> where it is ſaid, that in the Caſes of Arreſt and lying in Priſon, he ſhall be adjudged a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> from the time of his firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>

                        <hi>Note,</hi> This Caſe came by <hi>Writ of Error</hi> out of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> where <hi>Judgment</hi> was given for <hi>Walter;</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Judgment</hi> was affirmed in this <hi>Court</hi> principally upon the point, of <hi>Relation:</hi> For the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid, that it would be a great miſchief if it ſhould relate to the firſt Arreſt, as to the payment of Money to <hi>Strangers.</hi>

                     <p>THe Caſe upon a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> was to this effect; That <hi>J. S.</hi> being Seiſed in <hi>Fee</hi> had made a Conveyance of his <hi>Eſtate</hi> to the uſe of himſelf for Life, with divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders over to other perſons, with a power of <hi>Revocation</hi> by <hi>Writing</hi> under his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards the ſaid <hi>J. S.</hi> having a purpoſe to Revoke the ſaid <hi>Uſes,</hi> and make a new Settlement of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> he levied a <hi>Fine,</hi> and after the <hi>Fine</hi> he made a <hi>Deed,</hi> wherein he expreſſed that he Revoked the former <hi>Uſes,</hi> and ſo proceeded to a new <hi>Limitation</hi> by that <hi>Deed,</hi> and declared that the <hi>Fine</hi> by him limited ſhould be to the Vſes of the ſaid <hi>Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſole Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the Fine had extinguiſhed his Power, and by conſequence forfeited his Eſtate;</hi> or, <hi>Whether the Fine and Deed ſhould be taken as one Conveyance, and ſo be a good execution of his Power, and new limitation of the Uſes?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after many ſolemn Arguments it was Reſolved by the <hi>Chief Juſtice Herbert, Holloway</hi> and <hi>Wright,</hi> that the <hi>Fine</hi> was an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment of his <hi>Power,</hi> and that the <hi>Deed</hi> came too late, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Opinion of <hi>Juſtice Withens.

                           <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Michael Mitford</hi> was ſeiz'd of the Lands in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and of divers other Lands in Fee, and having Iſſue <hi>Robert</hi> by one Venter, and <hi>Ralph</hi> by <hi>Jane</hi> his ſecond Wife, did (23 <hi>Jan.</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi>) by Indenture Covenant to ſtand ſeized of ſome of the Lands to the uſe of himſelf for Life, Remainder to Truſtees for years for ſeveral purpoſes, Remainder to <hi>Jane</hi> his ſecond Wife for Life, Remainder to <hi>Ralph</hi> and the Heirs Male of his Body.</hi> And as to the Lands in queſtion, he Covenants to ſtand ſeiz'd <hi>To the uſe of his Heirs Male begotten, or to be begotten on the Body of his ſecond Wife, and died.</hi> And then the <hi>Jury</hi> made this <hi>Special Concluſion,</hi> If any <hi>Uſe</hi> did ariſe by the <hi>Deed</hi> to <hi>Ralph,</hi> then they find for the <hi>Defendant;</hi> and if not, they find for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Caſe was Argued ſeveral times at the Bar, and now the <hi>Judges</hi> delivered their Opinions <hi>ſeriatim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wild Juſtice</hi> for the <hi>Defendant:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are to give our <hi>Opinions</hi> upon a <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Uſes,</hi> made for the Proviſion of <hi>younger Children</hi> not otherwiſe provided for: But if the Caſe were not ſo, It is a ſafe way, when the Words are ambiguous, to follow the Intention of the party appearing in the <hi>Deed.</hi> I ſhall not maintain, that <hi>Ralph</hi> is a Purchaſer, and ſo make this an <hi>Executory Uſe:</hi> I agree, a man cannot either by Conveyance at <hi>Common Law,</hi> by <hi>Limitation</hi> of <hi>Uſes,</hi> or <hi>Deviſe,</hi> make his right <hi>Heir</hi> a Purchaſer; I agree alſo <hi>Griſwold's Caſe</hi> in <hi>Dyer 156.</hi> and if this Caſe had operated by Tranſmutation of Poſſeſſion, this Limitation to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Covenantor</hi> had been void, and no <hi>Uſe</hi> ſhould have riſen: But here, in the Caſe of a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiz'd,</hi> nothing moves
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:51792:188"/>
out of the <hi>Covenantor,</hi> he retains the <hi>Land</hi> and directs the <hi>Uſe,</hi> and keeps ſufficient in him to maintain this <hi>Uſe.</hi> There's a great difference between a <hi>Conveyance</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and a <hi>Conveyance</hi> to <hi>Uſes:</hi> At the <hi>Common Law,</hi> the <hi>Heir</hi> cannot take where the <hi>Anceſtor</hi> could not; but otherwiſe it is in caſe of <hi>Uſes, 2 Rolls 794.</hi> and ſo is <hi>Wood's Caſe, 1 Co. 99. a.</hi> cited in <hi>Shelly's Caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I ſay, to ſhew, that the Intent of the Parties ſhall be the Guide, and that there is a difference between <hi>Conveyances</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and <hi>Conveyances</hi> to <hi>Uſes. Horwood's Opinion</hi> in <hi>Huſſey's Caſe, 37 H. 8.</hi> comes to our Caſe; There's no great difference between a <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiz'd,</hi> and a <hi>Feoffment to Uſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not Argue to prove, that this <hi>Deed</hi> ſhall enure as an <hi>Executory Uſe,</hi> becauſe 'tis againſt a Rule in Law taken by my <hi>Lord Hobart,</hi> and ſo Agreed before his time: But here <hi>Ralph</hi> is <hi>Tenant in Tail, Michael</hi> his Father being <hi>Tenant for Life,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to his <hi>Heirs Male</hi> begotten on the Body of <hi>Jane</hi> his ſecond Wife. For the Law, to preſerve this Limitation to the uſe of his <hi>Heirs Male, &amp;c.</hi> will by Implication create an <hi>Eſtate for Life</hi> in <hi>Michael;</hi> becauſe the Intent of the parties appears, that it ſhould be ſo. There's no great difference between the Conſtruction of a <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Uſes</hi> and a <hi>Will, 13 H. 7.</hi> The Wife takes an Eſtate for Life by Implication, where the Land is deviſed to the eldeſt Son after her deceaſe, <hi>Manning and Andrew's Caſe</hi> in <hi>1 Leon. 259.</hi> The Reaſon of theſe Caſes, is the fulfilling of the Intention of the Parties; and here this <hi>Limitation</hi> cannot be made good by way of a <hi>Future Uſe,</hi> nor by any other way, but only by creating of an <hi>Eſtate for Life</hi> in <hi>Michael</hi> the Father by Implication, and this is according to the nature of a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeiz'd: For the <hi>Uſe</hi> is not to paſs out of the <hi>Covenantor</hi> till the proper time for the ſubſequent Eſtate to commence. As to my <hi>Lord Paget's Caſe,</hi> 'twas his Intention to have the <hi>Uſe</hi> during his Life. And my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> was certainly very well ſatisfied with the Reſolution in <hi>Fenwick and Mitford's Caſe,</hi> when he wrote his <hi>Inſtitutes;</hi> for he Argued before to the contrary, as appears by the Report of that Caſe in <hi>Moor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rainsford Juſtice</hi> to the ſame Intent.</p>
                     <p>If no <hi>Uſe</hi> riſes immediately to <hi>Ralph;</hi> yet if a <hi>Uſe</hi> riſes by the <hi>Deed</hi> ſo that he has the Land any way, be it by diſcent from his Father, 'tis within the Concluſion of the <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the ſcope of the <hi>Conveyance</hi> it appears, that it was intended, that <hi>Robert</hi> ſhould never have his Land till Twelve hundred Pound was paid for the proviſion of <hi>younger Children;</hi> ſo that if <hi>Robert</hi> ſhould have it, it would be againſt the Intention of <hi>Michael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="374" facs="tcp:51792:189"/>There are two Reaſons and Grounds in Law, by which we may make this <hi>Deed</hi> agree with the Intention of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it is in the Caſe of an Eſtate Tail, <hi>ubi voluntas donatoris obſervari debet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is in a <hi>Conveyance</hi> ſetled by way of <hi>Uſe,</hi> and in Caſes of <hi>Uſes</hi> the Intention of the parties ought to be purſued; And this is in Caſe of a <hi>Uſe</hi> that riſes by <hi>Covenant to ſtand ſeiz'd,</hi> which makes the Caſe the ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>And I conceive this is not a void <hi>Limitation,</hi> but ſuch an one as gives an Eſtate to <hi>Ralph.</hi> In ſpeaking to which I ſhall obſerve what my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> in the <hi>1 Inſt. 23.</hi> ſays, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo much of the <hi>Uſe</hi> as the Owner of the Land does not diſpoſe of, remains in him, &amp;c. and ſo in <hi>Cownden and Clark's Caſe</hi> in <hi>Hob. 30.</hi> And this is the Reaſon of <hi>Bingham's Caſe, 1 Co. 91.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here when <hi>Michael</hi> Covenanted to ſtand ſeiz'd to the Vſe of his <hi>Heirs Male</hi> on the Body of his ſecond Wife begotten, I conceive he ſhall retain the Land as parcel of his ancient Vſe during his Life; for <hi>non eſt Haeres viventis,</hi> according to <hi>Archer's Caſe, 1 Co.</hi> And that <hi>Michael</hi> ſhall retain an Eſtate for Life is prov'd by my <hi>Lord Paget's Caſe, 1 Co. 154. Dyer 310. N. 79. 1 Co. Chudleigh's Caſe 129. 2 Rolls 788. 21 H. 7. 18.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From my <hi>Lord Paget's Caſe</hi> (upon which I ſhall rely) and the other Caſes it appears, that were there's a Limitation to one after the death of another, the <hi>Covenantor</hi> ſhall retain the Land during the Life of the other; and here in our Caſe, this Eſtate not taking effect till after the Death of <hi>Michael,</hi> he ſhall retain the Eſtate, and ſhall be Tenant for Life of the old Vſe.</p>
                     <p>Now the Queſtion is, Whether <hi>Ralph</hi> ſhall take by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> or <hi>Purchaſe?</hi> And I conceive this Eſtate for Life, with the Remainder in Tail, makes but one <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> in <hi>Michael,</hi> and that he becomes <hi>Tenant in Tail,</hi> and ſo <hi>Ralph</hi> ſhall take as <hi>Heir in Tail.</hi> I ſhall not trouble my ſelf, whether <hi>Ralph</hi> may take here as a <hi>Purchaſer</hi> becauſe in <hi>Cownden and Clark's Caſe in Hob.</hi> it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that he cannot take as <hi>Heir Male</hi> of the Body by Purchaſe; becauſe all the words are not verified in him, for he is not <hi>Heir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall rely upon the <hi>Firſt Point,</hi> That here is an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> executed in <hi>Michael.</hi> For when an <hi>Eſtate for Life</hi> is in the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor by way of <hi>Retainer,</hi> and an Eſtate is afterwards limited to his <hi>Heirs,</hi> this is within the Rule put in <hi>Shelley's Caſe</hi> in <hi>1 Co.</hi> where the Aunceſtor takes an Eſtate of <hi>Freehold,</hi> and by the ſame <hi>Conveyance</hi> an Eſtate is limited to his Heirs, <hi>Mediately</hi> or <hi>Immediately,</hi> they are Words of Limitation, and not of Purchaſe; becauſe the <hi>Heir</hi> is part of his Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:51792:189"/>Our Caſe is ſtronger that <hi>Fenwick and Mitfords Caſe:</hi> Its true, the ſame Reaſon for that Caſe is not given by <hi>Anderſon and More,</hi> which is given by my <hi>Lord Coke, More 437.</hi> There the Reaſon is, becauſe the Limitation to the right <hi>Heirs</hi> is merely void; here <hi>Michael</hi> hath an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>Tail</hi> of the ancient <hi>Uſe,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not neceſſary for the <hi>Law</hi> to create an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>That this cannot be an Eſtate Tail executed in <hi>Michael,</hi> becauſe the Eſtate for Life is not by the ſame Limitation, but by Conſtruction of Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> ſays in <hi>Fenwick and Mitfords Caſe, 1 Inſt. 22. b.</hi> that there is no difference where the <hi>Eſtate</hi> is created by <hi>Law,</hi> and where by the <hi>Deed. 1 Anderſon 259.</hi> and the Law retaining an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>Michael</hi> for Life, our Caſe is the ſame, as if the <hi>Eſtate</hi> had been limited to him, with the Remainder to his <hi>Heirs Male</hi> begotten on his ſecond <hi>Wife,</hi> which would be an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> executed in <hi>Michael,</hi> and would have diſcended to <hi>Ralph.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I hold there's no <hi>Uſe</hi> raiſed to <hi>Ralph</hi> by this <hi>Deed.</hi> We are here in the conſtruction of a <hi>Deed,</hi> and not of a <hi>Will;</hi> It may be an <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſhould be raiſed in ſuch a caſe by a <hi>Will,</hi> altho' my <hi>Lord Hobart</hi> is of a contrary Opinion. I agree, the Caſe of <hi>Hodgkinſon and Wood, Cro. Car. 23.</hi> but it cannot be argued from thence, that it ſhall be ſo in a <hi>Deed,</hi> for a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is not to take effect till after the Death of the <hi>Deviſor,</hi> and then 'tis apparent, that he is <hi>Heir Male</hi> of his <hi>Body.</hi> It hath been agreed, that <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> are words of purchaſe: It is plain, that <hi>Ralph</hi> cannot take as <hi>Special Heir</hi> unleſs by Purchaſe, and that he cannot do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he who ſhall take by virtue of ſuch a Limitation ought to be <hi>Heir</hi> as well as <hi>Iſſue Male;</hi> and <hi>Ralph</hi> here cannot take by vertue of the <hi>Statute de Donis Conditionalibis</hi> becauſe none can take as <hi>Special Heir,</hi> but where his Anceſtor took before; and therefore this Limitation is utterly void.</p>
                     <p>To make this Limitation good, divers ways have been urged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this <hi>Deed</hi> has an operation by way of returning of the <hi>Uſe,</hi> and it has been compared to my <hi>Lord Pagets Caſe</hi> which differs from it; here cannot be any part of the old <hi>Uſe</hi> in <hi>Michael,</hi> for if he hath an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life, it ought to be a new <hi>Uſe;</hi> It cannot be a returning <hi>Uſe,</hi> for the Limitation to the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jane</hi> the ſecond <hi>Wife</hi> is void, and it cannot be returning where the <hi>Uſe</hi> is not ſetled in any Perſon. I agree, my <hi>Lord Pagets Caſe,</hi> becauſe there the <hi>Eſtate</hi> was veſted in <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Paget,</hi> and the other <hi>Uſe</hi> returned by operation of <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſetled could not be diveſted; but here the Limitation to the <hi>Heirs Males</hi> being void, the ancient <hi>Uſe</hi> remained yet in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> for nothing was out of him, he having limited a thing
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51792:190"/>
which cannot be. And as to a returning <hi>Uſe,</hi> tho' all be done in an inſtant, yet there is a priority of time in the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> for it ought to veſt firſt in him in Remainder, and then Return; but here nothing veſts in the Remainder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It hath béen urged, That it ſhall be made good by Implication of <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo ſhall amount to a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized to the <hi>Uſed</hi> of the <hi>Covenantor</hi> for Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it has béen ſaid by <hi>Wild,</hi> becauſe <hi>Uſes</hi> are guided by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                     <p>But I anſwer, we are here in caſe of a <hi>Deed,</hi> where an <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſhall not be raiſed by Implication, as it ſhall by a <hi>Will, Cro. Car. Seagood ad Hone 366.</hi> A <hi>Deed</hi> differs greatly from a <hi>Will,</hi> for if a <hi>Man</hi> Surrenders <hi>Copyhold Land</hi> to two, equally to be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are <hi>Joynt-tenants;</hi> but ſuch a <hi>Deviſe</hi> would have made them <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Common.</hi> Admit in ſome Caſe an <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſhall be raiſed by Implication in a <hi>Deed;</hi> yet it ſhall not be ſo here, for it would be to the diſinheriting the <hi>Heir:</hi> As to the caſe of <hi>13 H. 7.</hi> I agree, that a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to the <hi>Eldeſt Son,</hi> after the Death of the <hi>Wife,</hi> gives an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life to the <hi>Wife;</hi> but otherwiſe it would be upon ſuch a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to the <hi>Younger Son,</hi> for there the <hi>Eldeſt Son,</hi> and not the <hi>Wife</hi> ſhould have the <hi>Eſtate</hi> in the mean time, <hi>Cro. Jac. Horton and Horton 57.</hi> We are not herein <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabili materiâ,</hi> and therefore no conſtruction ſhall be made, which does not appear by the words. It hath béen ſtrongly urged, that this being by way of <hi>Uſe</hi> (which is a matter of Equity) ſhall be favoured. Admit it; yet it ſhall be guided by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> for <hi>aequitas ſequitur legem.</hi> There never ſhall be a Settlement by way of <hi>Uſe,</hi> to make one capable who is not capable by the <hi>Common Law.</hi> I do not ſee any difference between a <hi>Feoffment</hi> to <hi>Uſes,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized; for if a <hi>Feoffment</hi> be made to the uſe of one for Life, the <hi>Uſe</hi> ſhall return which is not diſpoſed of, as well as upon a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It has been urged, if theſe ſeverally cannot ſupport this Limitation; yet the intention operating with the <hi>Deed,</hi> will both together make an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life in <hi>Michael.</hi> But I do not ſee his intent here to have it for Life; the intention even in a <hi>Will,</hi> which is much ſtronger, ought to be collected out of the words of the <hi>Will. Cro. Car. Spirt and Bence 368.</hi> agreed by the whole <hi>Court,</hi> that words in a <hi>Will</hi> ought to have an apparent intent to diſinherit an <hi>Heir,</hi> and here there is not any apparent intent, but rather to the contrary; for of ſome <hi>Lands Michael Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeiſed to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of himſelf for Life, Remainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of the <hi>Lands</hi> in queſtion, he makes a difference in the Limitation: And the words of the <hi>Deed</hi> are to be conſidered, He <hi>Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeized to the <hi>Uſes, mentioned, declared and limited in the Deed,</hi> and if <hi>Michael</hi> ſhall have an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life, he muſt have
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:51792:190"/>
it by operation of <hi>Law.</hi> There was a like caſe between <hi>Flavil and Ventroiſe</hi> in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> in which the <hi>Court</hi> was divided; but the ſame Point came afterwards in queſtion, in the Caſe of <hi>Mr. Tape of Norfolk,</hi> and it was adjudged to be the ancient <hi>Uſe:</hi> And no Caſe can be ſhewn, that the <hi>Law</hi> will create an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in the <hi>Covenantor,</hi> where the <hi>Uſe</hi> is not veſted in any <hi>Perſon,</hi> but the ancient <hi>Uſe</hi> remains in him.</p>
                     <p>As to the Caſes cited on the other ſide, I have anſwered my <hi>Lord Pagets's Caſe</hi> already. And as to my <hi>Lord Cokes Caſe, 1 Inſt. 22. b.</hi> I agree the <hi>Uſe</hi> returns, and the <hi>Son</hi> is in by diſcent; and ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Fenwick and Mitfords Caſe</hi> there cited: But the Paraphraſe he makes there I do not underſtand; It is ſaid there, <hi>when the Limitation is made to his right Heirs, and right Heirs he cannot have during his Life, the Law doth create an Uſe in him during his Life:</hi> Wherefore is this ſaid? to make the <hi>Heir</hi> in by diſcent? No doubt without this he is in by diſcent, and ſo was the Iudgment in that Caſe; for what Reaſon then ſhould there be an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life raiſed by the Law, to be merg'd by the <hi>Fee</hi> as ſoon as raiſed?</p>
                     <p>And there 'tis ſaid, <hi>Till the future uſe come in Eſſe,</hi> I do not conceive then where it is ſo long as the <hi>Father</hi> lives, and what he means by the <hi>Future Uſe,</hi> I do not know, for it always was in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and never was out of the <hi>Feoffor,</hi> and this was ſo adjudg'd in that Caſe of <hi>Fenwick and Mitford,</hi> and not the conſtruction of my <hi>Lord Coke:</hi> And tis ſtrange, that no other <hi>Reports</hi> ſhould mention his conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hale Chief Juſtice</hi> for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If <hi>Ralph</hi> takes either by Diſcent from <hi>Michael,</hi> or by Purchaſe, the one way or the other anſwers the <hi>Verdict,</hi> and the <hi>Iſſue</hi> is for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall divide the Caſe into two Points.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> If he takes by Diſcent?</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Admitting he does not, If he may take by Purchaſe, as this Caſe is I ſhall Premiſe two or three things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It has been agreed, if an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life be raiſed to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> the Remainder being to his <hi>Heirs Male,</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jane</hi> his ſecond <hi>Wife,</hi> the <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> is executed in him; be the <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life raiſed by Implication, or expreſs Limitation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is plain <hi>quacunque via It be rais'd,</hi> that the <hi>Eſtate</hi> was long'd in <hi>Michael,</hi> till <hi>Ralph</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> be in a capacity to take it, either by Diſcent or Purchaſe; for be it part of the ancient <hi>Uſe,</hi> or a new <hi>Uſe,</hi> it ought to be in <hi>Michael</hi> during his Life, for there is nothing to bring it out of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:51792:191"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In all Caſes touching <hi>Uſes,</hi> there is a great difference between a <hi>Feoffment</hi> to <hi>Uſes,</hi> a <hi>Covenant</hi> to ſtand ſeized, and a conveyance at the <hi>Common Law.</hi> If a <hi>Man</hi> by <hi>Feoffment</hi> to uſes conveys Land to the uſe of <hi>J.S.</hi> for Life; he may remit the <hi>Uſe</hi> to himſelf, and the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> by the ſame <hi>Deed,</hi> and ſo alter that wich was before a <hi>Fee ſimple,</hi> and turn it into another <hi>Eſtate;</hi> but if <hi>A.</hi> gives Land to <hi>B.</hi> for Life, Remainder to <hi>A.</hi> and the <hi>Heirs, Male</hi> of his <hi>Body;</hi> becauſe a <hi>Man</hi> cannot give to himſelf, the Remainder is void, for a <hi>Man</hi> cannot convey to himſelf by a <hi>Conveyance</hi> at the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I conceive here is an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> in <hi>Michael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe in this Caſe the <hi>Uſe</hi> returns by operation of <hi>Law,</hi> and executes an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>Michael</hi> for Life, which being conjoined to the <hi>Eſtate</hi> limited to the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> makes an <hi>Eſtate Tail:</hi> This <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life riſing by operation of Law, is as ſtrong as if it had been limitted to him for his Life, and after his deceaſe to the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his <hi>Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe that a Limitation to the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> is in Conſtruction of <hi>Law,</hi> a Limitation to himſelf and the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his <hi>Body.</hi> There is a great difference, when he who has the <hi>Uſe,</hi> limits it to <hi>A.</hi> for Life, the Remainder to the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> here no <hi>Eſtate</hi> can riſe to <hi>B.</hi> becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moved from him, but where he who has the <hi>Eſtate</hi> limits it to the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his own <hi>Body, ut res valeat,</hi> he ſhall have it for his Life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is plainly according to the intent of the Parties; the intent perfectly appears, that the <hi>Iſſue</hi> by the ſecond <hi>Wife</hi> ſhould take, and that <hi>Robert</hi> the eldeſt <hi>Son</hi> ſhould not take till ſo much <hi>Money</hi> be paid; therefore, if we can by any means ſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the parties, we ought to do it as good Expoſitors. For as my <hi>Lord Hobart</hi> ſays, <hi>Judges</hi> in Conſtruction of <hi>Deeds</hi> do no harm, if they are <hi>aſtuti</hi> in ſerving the intent of the Parties without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating any Law.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Here the Uſe being never out of <hi>Michael,</hi> he hath the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Uſe which is the <hi>Fee ſimple,</hi> and conſequently being the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Uſe, and this being a new Limitation to the Heirs Male of his Body, the ancient uſe and the new one cannot be piec'd, to make an Eſtate Tail executed in <hi>Michael,</hi> but it ſhall be a Contingent Uſe (if any) which ought to riſe to the Heir Male of his Body, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ancient <hi>Fee ſimple.</hi> And it hath been compared to theſe Caſes. If a Man Covenants to ſtand ſeized to the Uſe of <hi>J.S.</hi> or of his Son after his Marriage, or after the Death of <hi>J. D.</hi> theſe are Contingent Limitations, and there is a <hi>Fee ſimple</hi> determinable in the Covenantor to ſerve the future Uſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="379" facs="tcp:51792:191"/>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> 'Tis true, if a Man <hi>Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeized to ſuch <hi>Uſes,</hi> as that he leaves a diſcendible <hi>Eſtate</hi> in himſelf: As if a Man <hi>Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeized to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi> from and after his <hi>Marriage,</hi> this is purely a Contingent <hi>Uſe,</hi> becauſe tis poſſible the <hi>Marriage</hi> may never take effect, and nothing is fetch'd out of the <hi>Covenantor;</hi> ſo if he <hi>Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeized to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>J. S.</hi> after <hi>40</hi> years, there is a <hi>Fee ſimple</hi> determinable in the <hi>Covenantor,</hi> and therefore thoſe Caſes are not to be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to our Caſe, where the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of <hi>Michael</hi> cannot continue longer than his Life. And this without any wrong done to any <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> may be turned to a <hi>Uſe</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> and therefore ſuch conſtruction ſhall be.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>2. Here is an Eſtate to riſe by way of Uſe by a Deed, and not by a Will, which ſhall not be by Implication by a Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> Its a certain truth: But we are not here upon raiſing an <hi>Eſtate</hi> by Implication, but qualifying an <hi>Eſtate</hi> that is now in the <hi>Father,</hi> which by this new <hi>Deed</hi> is to be qualified to be an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> to preſerve the <hi>Eſtate Tail;</hi> ſo that the Caſes of Implication are not to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>3. In this Caſe <hi>Michael</hi> ſhall be in of his ancient Eſtate in <hi>Fee ſimple</hi> which is in him, and not of a new Eſtate created by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Law; and it hath been compared to the Deviſe of Land to a Mans Heir, he ſhall not be in by the Deviſe, but of his ancient Eſtate, that would have deſcended to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> True: But in this Caſe a Man may qualifie his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> as in <hi>Gilpins Caſe, Cro. Ca. 161.</hi> Deviſe to his <hi>Heir,</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhall pay his <hi>Debts</hi> in a year; the <hi>Heir</hi> is a <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;</hi> ſo here is a qualification to turn the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of <hi>Michael</hi> into an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life, <hi>ut res valeat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>4. <hi>Michael</hi> had not an Intention to have an Eſtate for Life, for in the Limitation of the other Lands, he has limited them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to himſelf for Life, and if he had intended to have had an Eſtate for Life in the Lands in queſtion, he would alſo have ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſp.</hi> The intention will not controul the operation of Law; his main intent was to ſettle the Lands upon his younger <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> this the Law ſerves, but not his ſecondary intentions; If a Man <hi>Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeized to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of himſelf for Life, without impeachment of <hi>Waſt,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Heirs Male</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> the Law ſupervenes his intention, and makes him to be <hi>Tenant</hi> in <hi>Tail.</hi> And in our Caſe there was a neceſſity to limit the other Lands to himſelf for Life, becauſe there was another <hi>Eſtate</hi> to intervene the <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life, and the <hi>Eſtate Tail.</hi> The Reaſon given by my <hi>Lord Coke,</hi> in <hi>Fenwick and Mitfords Caſe</hi> is plain enough, and it appears that he was of that Opinion afterwards by the Report of <hi>Pannel and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:51792:192"/>
Lanes Caſe, 13 Jac. in Rolls Rep. 1 part. 238.</hi> The Caſe upon which I ſhall rely, which has not been anſwered, is my <hi>Lord Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Caſe,</hi> adjudged by all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tho. Lord Paget Covenants</hi> in conſideration of the diſcharge of his Funerals, Payment of his Debts and Legacies out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his Land, and for the advancement of his <hi>Son, Brother</hi> and others of his <hi>Blood;</hi> that he and his <hi>Heirs</hi> would ſtand ſeized of divers <hi>Mannors</hi> to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>T.F.</hi> one of the <hi>Covenantees,</hi> for the Life of my <hi>Lord Paget,</hi> and after his Death to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>C.

And the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, What <hi>Eſtate</hi> he has during his Life; It is adjudged, that he has an <hi>Eſtate</hi> for Life, for if there had been a <hi>Contingent Fee ſimple</hi> in the <hi>Lord Paget,</hi> his <hi>Heir</hi> could never have had an <hi>Amoveas manus;</hi> for if a <hi>Man Covenants</hi> to ſtand ſeized to a <hi>Contingent Uſe,</hi> and afterwards is attainted of <hi>Treaſon</hi> before the <hi>Contingency</hi> happen, the <hi>Contingency</hi> ſhall never riſe, for the <hi>King</hi> has the <hi>Eſtate</hi> diſcharged, and the <hi>Uſe</hi> is to riſe out of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Covenantor;</hi> ſo is <hi>Moor, Sir Tho Palmers Caſe 815, In Moors Rep.</hi> of my <hi>Lord Pagets Caſe, 194.</hi> Its ſaid, that <hi>W.

I have not read any Caſe againſt this. <hi>Hill. 16. or 26 Eliz.</hi> there was this Caſe. A Man taking notice in his <hi>Will,</hi> that his Brother (who was dead) had a <hi>Son,</hi> and that he himſelf had three <hi>Daughters</hi> who were his right and immediate <hi>Heirs,</hi> he gave them <hi>2000 l</hi> and gave his <hi>Land</hi>

And it was reſolved, that the <hi>Deviſor</hi> taking notice, that others were his <hi>Heirs,</hi> the Limitation to his <hi>Brothers Son</hi> by the name of <hi>Heir Male</hi> was a good name of Purchaſe; and this agrees with <hi>Cownden and Clarks Caſe,</hi> in <hi>Hob.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>ſeveral Freeholders</hi> cannot joyn, or be joyned in a <hi>Preſcription</hi> to claim an entire Intereſt in another mans Soyl, as annexed to their ſeveral Eſtates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Intereſt of <hi>ſola &amp; ſeperalis Paſtura,</hi> is an entire Intereſt, and cannot be claimed both by <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Owner of the Soyl cannot be wholly excluded out of the Soyl at all times, as this <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> import.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This is a new Invention in Pleading, framed to overthrow a <hi>Maxim</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and is of miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="385" facs="tcp:51792:194"/>Tho' but one man pleads, yet 'tis a <hi>Joynt Preſcription</hi> that he Iuſtifies by, and he involves all their <hi>Eſtates</hi> in his Preſcription, and preſcribes for the whole thing belonging to all their <hi>Eſtates;</hi> ſo that 'tis the ſame thing in ſubſtance, as if they had joyned in Pleading.</p>
                     <p>If he had pleaded, <hi>That he, together with all the Freeholders and Copyholders, &amp;c.</hi> he had preſcribed alone, and only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but that would have been naught, becauſe the ſole <hi>Paſture</hi> cannot by any <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Preſcription</hi> be annexed to their <hi>ſeveral Eſtates,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn afterwards.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the Nature of the thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Rules of <hi>Preſcription.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Examine the Caſe by thoſe Rules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I admit that there is a ſole and ſeveral <hi>Paſture,</hi> and that it lies in <hi>Preſcription.</hi> Caſes are frequent, where one man hath the <hi>firſt Crop</hi> and the <hi>Soyl,</hi> and another man hath the <hi>Paſturage</hi> or <hi>ſole Feeding</hi> till the <hi>Sowing again, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conceive it to be in its Nature a certain and determinate <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Profit;</hi> I mean in diſtinction to an incertain Profit <hi>a prender.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To have <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Paſturage</hi> for Beaſts <hi>levant</hi> and <hi>couchant</hi> upon ſuch Land, or to have <hi>Eſtovers</hi> to be ſpent in ſuch an Houſe, without any determinate quantity or number, I call <hi>incertain;</hi> for it is to be meaſured only by Vſe and Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>But to have <hi>Paſture</hi> or <hi>Common</hi> for <hi>100 Sheep,</hi> or <hi>Eſtovers</hi> of a certain quantity, as ten Load of <hi>Wood,</hi> is <hi>certain</hi> every year, and differs very much in its Nature from an <hi>incertain</hi> profit <hi>a prender.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for Example: The <hi>Levancy</hi> and <hi>Couchancy</hi> is not traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, nor the employment of <hi>Eſtovers</hi> certain; becauſe that no Surcharge can be to the Owner, <hi>Yelv. 188, 189.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be granted from the Land <hi>a que, 2 Cro. 15. Drury and Kent;</hi> for the ſame Reaſon, in caſe of <hi>ſole Paſturage,</hi> the party that claims it having a general <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and the Owner being wholly excluded, it is not material with what Cattel it be taken tho' they preſcribe with an <hi>Exception</hi> of ſome; for if there be an <hi>Overplus</hi> the Owner cannot have it.</p>
                     <p>Now as there may be ſuch an <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſo I admit that ſeveral perſons may have it; but it muſt be as <hi>Joyntenants</hi> or <hi>Tenants in Common,</hi> where they have ſeveral <hi>Rights</hi> by <hi>Moieties</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parties:</hi> But ſeveral men cannot claim the <hi>Entiertie</hi> of this profit by <hi>Preſcription,</hi> as I ſhall after ſhew. If ſuch a Profit <hi>a prender</hi> as this be annexed to <hi>Land,</hi> 'tis appurtenant by <hi>Preſcription</hi> or <hi>Grant,</hi> and if part of the Land <hi>a que, &amp;c.</hi> is aliened, the <hi>Entiertie</hi> cannot belong to both their Eſtates, but there ſhall be an appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment, <hi>(ſcilt.)</hi> the <hi>Alienee</hi> ſhall have the ſame proportion for
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:51792:195"/>
the <hi>ſole Paſturage,</hi> that he has of the Land <hi>a que, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſame manner as it would be in a Caſe of <hi>Common appurtenant certain,</hi> for which there will be an <hi>apportionment</hi> in ſuch caſes, as was Adjudged <hi>7 Jac. inter Moreton &amp; Woods, 1 Rolls 235.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this concerning the Nature of the <hi>Intereſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I will now ſpeak concerning the Nature and Rules of <hi>Preſcription.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Preſcription</hi> that is to claim a real Intereſt of Profit in <hi>ſolo alieno,</hi> is a <hi>Title,</hi> and as a <hi>Title</hi> muſt be ſtrictly and curiouſly pleaded, and is not like <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> that are by way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and for Eaſments, or for Matters of perſonal Exemption or Priviledge.</p>
                     <p>A man may lay a <hi>Preſcription</hi> in a great many, where it tends but to claim an Eaſment or Diſcharge, and not Matter of Intereſt and Profit, <hi>15 E. 4. 29. 18 E. 4. 3.</hi> to ſay, <hi>That all the Inhabitants have had ſuch an Eaſment, &amp;c.</hi> or, <hi>to have been Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, &amp;c.</hi> will be well: And for Matters of Priviledges a <hi>Preſcription</hi> may be in General; for it is but a Matter of <hi>Exemption,</hi> and <hi>Perſonal,</hi> and is called a <hi>Preſcription</hi> in diſtinction to a <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> becauſe <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is meerly local, and this is to perſons, yet having reſpect to ſuch a place, as <hi>All the Citizens, &amp;c</hi> as in <hi>Day and Savage's Caſe</hi> in <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> Or having reſpect to ſuch a Condition, as <hi>All Serjeants at Law,</hi> or <hi>All Attorneys of ſuch a Court,</hi> ſuch <hi>Preſcription</hi> muſt be in generalty, to expreſs the extent and nature of the <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and ſo always have been allowed.</p>
                     <p>But a <hi>Preſcription</hi> to claim a Profit, or an Intereſt, <hi>in alieno ſolo</hi> is a <hi>Title;</hi> and as in ſetting forth <hi>Titles</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is curious in pleading, and lays down ſtrict Rules, which muſt be obſerved;, ſo in pleading ſuch <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> the Rules taught in our Books, and the Courſe of Pleading hitherto uſed muſt be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                     <p>One Rule of ſuch <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> is, <hi>That the Thing preſcribed for by a <hi>que Eſtate</hi>
                        </hi> (not in <hi>groſs,</hi> but <hi>appendant</hi> or <hi>appurtenant</hi>) <hi>muſt agree in the Nature and Quality of the thing to which it is annexed or appurtenant.</hi> Corporeal things cannot be appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Corporeal, becauſe they are diſtinct, and can have no relation one to another. <hi>Eſtovers</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> cannot be appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Land,</hi> becauſe they cannot be uſed for it, <hi>1 Inſt. 121. b. 122. a.</hi> If a man would plead, <hi>That he and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate, &amp;c. in Black-Acre, &amp;c. Time out of mind, have had Ten Load every year, to be taken, &amp;c. <hi>tanquam ſpectant', &amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi> upon <hi>Demurrer</hi> this would be naught; becauſe it does not agree with the Rules of <hi>Law.</hi> And <hi>Uſage</hi> may be objected in that caſe; but <hi>Uſage</hi> alone makes but a <hi>Title</hi> in groſs, which will ſerve when it has <hi>Time out of mind</hi> continued in the ſame <hi>Hereditary line.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:51792:195"/>
                        <hi>Uſage</hi> cannot annex a <hi>Thing</hi> that cannot in nature be uſed with the <hi>Thing</hi> to which it ſhould be annexed.</p>
                     <p>One other Rule of <hi>Preſcription</hi> for Matters of Intereſt, is, <hi>That nothing can be preſcribed for, that cannot at this day be raiſed by Grant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Law</hi> allows <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> but in ſupply of the loſs of a <hi>Grant.</hi> Ancient <hi>Grants</hi> happen to be loſt many times, and it would be hard that no <hi>Title</hi> could be made to things that lye in Grant, but by ſhewing of a <hi>Grant:</hi> Therefore upon <hi>Uſage temps d'ont, &amp;c.</hi> the Law preſumes a <hi>Grant</hi> and a <hi>Lawful beginning,</hi> and allows ſuch <hi>Uſage</hi> for a good <hi>Title;</hi> but ſtill it is but in ſupply of the loſs of a <hi>Grant:</hi> And therefore for ſuch things as can have no <hi>Lawful beginning,</hi> nor be <hi>Created</hi> at this day by any manner of <hi>Grant,</hi> or <hi>Reſervation,</hi> or <hi>Deed</hi> that can be ſuppoſed, no <hi>Preſcription</hi> is good, <hi>11 H. 7. 13, 14. 13 H. 7. 16. per Keble, 21 H. 7. 40.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preſcription</hi> for a <hi>Lord</hi> to have ſo much for every Pound breach, is a good <hi>Preſcription</hi> to bind the <hi>Tenants,</hi> but naught as to <hi>Strangers;</hi> becauſe as to the <hi>Tenants</hi> it might have a good <hi>beginning</hi> by way of <hi>Reſervation,</hi> but as to a <hi>Stranger</hi> it could have no <hi>Lawful beginning</hi> by way of <hi>Grant,</hi> or <hi>Reſervation,</hi> or any way that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Now if we examine the <hi>Preſcription</hi> in the Caſe in Queſtion, by theſe Rules we ſhall find;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Thing</hi> preſcribed for does not agree in the nature and quality nor is applicable to the <hi>Thing</hi> to which it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Thing</hi> preſcribed for is an entire, determinate <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and the <hi>Thing</hi> to which it is annexed is ſeveral <hi>Eſtates</hi> that have no relation one to another; the <hi>Uſage</hi> of one can have no relation to the <hi>Uſage</hi> of another.</p>
                     <p>I would put this Caſe. In an <hi>Action of Treſpaſs,</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> Iuſtifies for <hi>Eſtovers certain,</hi> or <hi>Paſture certain</hi> in this <hi>Mannor,</hi> and that he is ſeiſed of a <hi>Meſſuage, &amp;c.</hi> in Fee, and that <hi>J. S.</hi> is ſeiſed of another <hi>Meſſuage, &amp;c.</hi> in Fee, and that he and <hi>J. S.</hi> and all they whoſe <hi>Eſtates</hi> they have in the ſaid two <hi>Meſſuages,</hi> have had ten Load of <hi>Wood, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Feeding</hi> for <hi>500</hi> Beaſts: Or, if two <hi>Lords</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Mannors</hi> in Fee joyn in preſcribing for a certain <hi>Rent,</hi> under Favour it were abſurd and never was known or allowed; for the <hi>Things</hi> to which, &amp;c. being ſeveral, the <hi>Uſage</hi> of neceſſity muſt be ſeveral, and the <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> alſo muſt be ſeveral: As for Example, For one of them to preſcribe for a <hi>Moiety, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſon why a man cannot preſcribe to have <hi>Eſtovers</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> to <hi>Land</hi> is, becauſe there can be no <hi>Uſage</hi> to annex it; for it cannot be uſed with it; and in all Caſes <hi>Preſcription</hi> follows

the nature of the <hi>Uſage;</hi> and therefore in the Caſe at Bar, the <hi>Uſage</hi> being ſeveral, and the <hi>Eſtates</hi> ſeveral, the <hi>Preſcription</hi> ought to be ſeveral alſo.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to raiſe ſuch an Intereſt by a <hi>Grant</hi> at this day; for if ſuch a <hi>Grant</hi> were now made, either the <hi>Grantees</hi> would be <hi>Joyntenants</hi> of this Intereſt, and then there would be a <hi>Survivorſhip,</hi> or elſe they would be <hi>Tenants in Common</hi> of it, and their <hi>ſeveral Intereſts</hi> might be annexed to their <hi>ſeveral Eſtates</hi> by <hi>Purparties</hi> or <hi>Apportionment:</hi> And ſo it would be in the nature of <hi>ſeveral Grants;</hi> and there muſt be to ſeveral <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> ſeveral Men that have had <hi>Land</hi> time out of mind, yet cannot joyn in making <hi>Title,</hi> but muſt make it ſeverally. As for Example:</p>
                     <p>If there be <hi>Three,</hi> one of them muſt ſay, <hi>That his Father was ſeiſed of a Third part that diſcended to him,</hi> and ſo make a <hi>Title</hi> againſt a <hi>Stranger,</hi> tho' there be a joynt Poſſeſſion: And if he be to make a <hi>Title</hi> againſt his <hi>Companions,</hi> he may ſay, <hi>That he and all thoſe whoſe Eſtates they have in the other Two parts;</hi> they cannot ſay, <hi>That their three Fathers were ſeiſed of the Lands, and ſhew the ſeveral Diſcents;</hi> nor, <hi>That they Two, and all whoſe Eſtates they have in Two parts in Three to be divided, have held in Common.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Title</hi> of the one concerns not the other; they are upon <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Diſcents;</hi> and <hi>Preſcription</hi> is making of a <hi>Title,</hi> as was ſaid before; and the Law is as ſtrict in it, or rather more ſtrict, than in making of a <hi>Title</hi> to Land.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſeveral Men that have ſeveral Eſtates, and no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one to another, cannot joyn in making a <hi>Preſcription;</hi> for the <hi>Preſcription</hi> of one does not concern the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Raſtal's Entries 622. d. en Treſpaſs, &amp;c.</hi> Two <hi>Commoners</hi> (to avoid prolixity and repetition) do, as near as they can, joyn in a <hi>Preſcription;</hi> but being conſidered, it is a ſeveral <hi>Preſcription,</hi> as much as if they had Iuſtified ſeverally.</p>
                     <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Rule on <hi>Littleton 197. a.</hi> That <hi>Tenants in Common</hi> may joyn in an <hi>Aſſize</hi> for an entire thing, as an <hi>Hawk,</hi> or an <hi>Horſe</hi> for the neceſſity of the caſe. It may be objected, that there is the ſame neceſſity here, I Anſwer,</p>
                     <p>That tho' in that caſe they joyn in the Demand and the Action, yet they muſt make their <hi>Titles</hi> ſeverally as they are, they muſt Sue as they may Recover, which cannot be half an <hi>Hawk,</hi> or half an <hi>Horſe;</hi> but when they come to make their <hi>Titles</hi> in Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they muſt ſet them forth diſtinct; there the poſſeſſion is joynt and cannot be ſevered; but in our caſe the poſſeſſions are ſeveral, and one hath nothing to do with the other, and the thing claimed is in its nature ſeverable, either by <hi>Moieties, Purparties</hi> or <hi>Appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:51792:196"/>It may be Objected againſt my Rule, <hi>That a Preſcription muſt be, as a Grant may at this day be made, that (11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 13, 14.) a man may preſcribe againſt a great many as Tenants, or a Commonalty, without naming a party certain; and ſuch a Preſcription cannot ſpring out of one Grant no more than this. For if a great many may joyn in one Grant, yet it is ſo many ſeveral Grants as to their ſeveral Intereſts; and ſo it may be ſaid, there ought to be ſo many ſeveral Preſcriptions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, The Rules are not alike: For if <hi>100</hi> Men, being a <hi>Generality</hi> (as all the <hi>Tenants</hi> of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi>) make the ſame king of <hi>Grant</hi> to <hi>J.S.</hi> or there be the ſame kind of Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the thing claimed be annexable to the Eſtate of <hi>J. S.</hi> theſe all unite in the <hi>Grantee</hi> and his Eſtate, and the Eſtate continues entire, <hi>Time</hi> knits and unites it, and an entire <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> will ſerve, being it will ſerve the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>But when a <hi>Grant</hi> is made from one to many that have ſeveral Eſtates, their Eſtates are carried and diſcended ſeveral ways, and <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Uſage</hi> makes them diſtinct and ſeveral, and cannot be ſerved by the ſame <hi>Preſcription.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Preſcription</hi> at Bar is worſe upon my Second Reaſon; for <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> are of contrary Natures and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible, and cannot give being to the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preſcription</hi> is a <hi>Title</hi> preſuming a <hi>Grant</hi> to the <hi>Freeholders</hi> and a <hi>Lawful beginning.</hi> The <hi>Copyholders</hi> claim by <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> becauſe they are but <hi>Tenants at Will</hi> and not capable of a <hi>Grant;</hi> their this muſt be raiſed from the <hi>Lord</hi> by parcels', which being an Entire thing it cannot be: For which ſoever ſhould be raiſed firſt, the reſt muſt be left in the <hi>Lord,</hi> who cannot have a Right of <hi>ſole Paſturage</hi> in his own Soyl diſtinct from the Soyl.</p>
                     <p>It may be Objected here, <hi>That Cuſtom and Preſcription are not of ſuch contrary Natures as I make them; for in <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Savage</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Hob.</hi> 85. the Pleadings were as a Cuſtom of the City, and the Court Adjudged it to be a <hi>Preſcription;</hi> which ſhews, that <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Preſcription</hi> differ not ſo much in the nature of the Thing, as in the manner of the Pleading.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Anſwer, I need but obſerve the Nature of that Caſe. The Officers of the City of <hi>London</hi> Iuſtified for a Duty of <hi>Wharfage</hi> claimed by the <hi>City.</hi> The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſets forth in his <hi>Replication, That within the City there is a Cuſtom for all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be Diſcharged, &amp;c.</hi> and the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether this was a Cuſtom to be tryed by the Mouth of the <hi>Recorder,</hi> or a Preſcription to be tried <hi>per Pais?</hi>
                        </hi> It was held to be in its Nature, a Preſcription; and if it were not, that it was Adjudged that it ought not to be tryed by their <hi>Certificate</hi> who were concerned in Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="390" facs="tcp:51792:197"/>The <hi>Preſcription</hi> there meant by the <hi>Court,</hi> was not a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> to claim a real Intereſt, as in this Caſe; but it was (as I may call it) a <hi>local Preſcription</hi> to priviledge Perſons in a certain Place and Condition, which is in its Nature betwixt a <hi>Preſcription</hi> and a <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and not a <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Diſcharge of perſons. And it is not meerly <hi>Local,</hi> nor a <hi>Preſcription;</hi> becauſe it is not annexed to any Eſtate nor to any Perſon; but in relation to a certain Place and Condition. And yet it is rather termed a <hi>Preſcription;</hi> for it is ſaid, That Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants may preſcribe for an <hi>Eaſement</hi> or a <hi>Diſcharge;</hi> but a ſtrict <hi>Preſcription</hi> to make <hi>Title</hi> to a Real Intereſt is ſo nice, that it cannot be pleaded by way of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> nor confounded with it. <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> or <hi>Freemen,</hi> or <hi>Citizens</hi> cannot preſcribe in that kind.</p>
                     <p>I muſt add to ſtrengthen my Reaſons upon theſe two Matters, that no Preſident can be ſhewn in all our <hi>Books</hi> of any ſuch Caſe, either where two <hi>Freeholders</hi> joyn to claim a Real Intereſt <hi>in ſolo alieno,</hi> or where <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> are mixed, as in this Caſe.</p>
                     <p>It will be no Objection that it cannot be pleaded better when it appears the very thing cannot conſiſt with the Principles of <hi>Law;</hi> for tho' there be ſuch a thing as <hi>ſeveral Paſture,</hi> and frequent, which may be appurtenant to a <hi>Meſſuage,</hi> yet it cannot be annexed to the Eſtates of ſo many ſeveral <hi>Freeholders</hi> and <hi>Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders:</hi> But if the thing were conſiſtent with Principles of <hi>Law,</hi> the Pleading here is naught to mix a <hi>Preſcription</hi> and a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> together, which are incompatible.</p>
                     <p>The whole ought to have been laid by way of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> it being an Entire thing, and the neceſſity of the Caſe would have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>J.S.</hi> makes a <hi>Feoffment</hi> to the uſe of the <hi>Feoffee</hi> and <hi>Feoffor</hi> and their <hi>Heirs,</hi> one cannot be in by the <hi>Common Law</hi> and another by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Uſes;</hi> but hath ſhall be in by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Uſes.</hi> So here, the Entire thing not being to be maintained, poſſibly hath <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> ſhould have been laid by way of <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> for the <hi>Freeholders</hi> in caſe of Neceſſity (it may be) might claim by <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> tho' the <hi>Copyholders</hi> could not preſcribe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> My third Reaſon is, becauſe the Owner of the Soyl can by no <hi>Preſcription</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom</hi> be excluded out of his own Soyl at all times of the year. And this Reaſon I principally depend on, becauſe it ſtrikes at the very Root and Eſſence of the thing.</p>
                     <p>I know there are many Caſes in our Books of <hi>Uſages,</hi> that have been all owed in reſtraint of the <hi>Owner</hi> of the Soyl; I ſhall not oppoſe any one of them, but admit them all; yet oppoſe this
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:51792:197"/>
                        <hi>Preſcription</hi> of which I may confidently ſay, there is not one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in all our <hi>Books.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will admit the <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Owner</hi> may be excluded for a certain time, according to the <hi>Books, Fitzh. tit. Preſcription 51. Huttons Rep. 45. Pitt and Cheekes Caſe,</hi> and the ſame Caſe <hi>6 Co.</hi> by the name of <hi>Sparks Caſe,</hi> and <hi>Co. on Litt. 122. a.</hi> where he ſays, a <hi>Man</hi> may preſcribe to have <hi>ſolam veſturam,</hi> from ſuch a day to ſuch a day, and thereby the <hi>Owner</hi> of the <hi>Soil</hi> may be excluded from <hi>Feeding</hi> there, ſo he may preſcribe to have <hi>Separal' paſturam,</hi> and exclude the <hi>Owner</hi> of the <hi>Soil</hi> from <hi>Feeding</hi> there.</p>
                     <p>I know that they object, that my <hi>Lord Co.</hi> is to be underſtood as to <hi>Separal' paſtur',</hi> that it may be at all times in the year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does not reſtrain it as he does the <hi>ſolam paſturam.</hi> But certainly the <hi>Law</hi> is the ſame for the one as for the other, and the <hi>Books</hi> muſt be intended for the one as well as for the other, for coming immediately next, there needed no Repetition for the latter, but the <hi>(ſo)</hi> ſignifies in the ſame manner, and ſo underſtood I admit it.</p>
                     <p>I admit the <hi>Lord or Owner</hi> may be ſtinted as to his kind of <hi>Cattel;</hi> and have none but <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Horſes,</hi> and ſo he may be ſtinted to a certain number, according to <hi>Kenwrick and Pargiters Caſe. Yel. 129. 2 Cro. 208.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I admit the <hi>Lord or Owner</hi> may be excluded as to ſome kind of profits: An other <hi>Man</hi> may preſcribe to have <hi>omnes Spinas</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a <hi>Waſt,</hi> according to <hi>Dowglaſs and Kendals Caſe, Yel. 187. 2 Cro. 256.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for this Reaſon, a <hi>Man</hi> may preſcribe to have <hi>ſolam piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> upon anothers <hi>Soil,</hi> for there he leaves the Owner the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the <hi>Soil</hi> for Manuring of his Ground or Ballaſtage, which the Owner has beſides the Property and the uſe of the <hi>Water,</hi> ſo that he leaves enough for the ſubſiſtence of the <hi>Fiſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, I ſhall agree further, that the <hi>Lord</hi> may be excluded wholly from the feeding of his <hi>Ground,</hi> upon <hi>Special Matter</hi> ſhewn to the <hi>Court,</hi> whereby it may appear that the <hi>Lord</hi> has ſome recompence, or takes the profits ſome other way; as if there be a <hi>Park</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> where the <hi>Lord</hi> has the <hi>Game,</hi> an other <hi>Man</hi> may preſcribe to have the <hi>Herbage,</hi> for the <hi>Lord</hi> has conſiderable profits of the <hi>Ground</hi> by his <hi>Deer,</hi> which is ſo conſiderable, that if the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe come to be determined, it hath been held that ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription for <hi>Herbage</hi> being but ſurpluſage after the feeding of the <hi>Deer</hi> and ſubordinate to it, ſhall rather be loſt than carry the whole profit of the feeding and exclude the Owner. And it has been the Caſe of many <hi>Parks,</hi> that have been diſparked by the <hi>King,</hi> after the <hi>Herbage</hi> granted away; ſo if there be <hi>Mines</hi> opened, or any other profit, that appears to the <hi>Court</hi> to be left to the Owner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:51792:198"/>I do not oppoſe, but that the paſturage may be claimed by preſcription.</p>
                     <p>But to have the <hi>Sole paſturage</hi> of all <hi>Paſture Grounds</hi> at all times in the year, is to have the whole profit of the <hi>Ground,</hi> and the <hi>Owner</hi> is wholly excluded, which would be very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. I ſhall agree yet further, that upon a <hi>Special Caſe</hi> ſhown to the <hi>Court</hi> in the <hi>Pleading,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> may be excluded from any pernancy of profit in his own <hi>Soil,</hi> as putting this Caſe; a <hi>Lord</hi> hath improved ſo much of his <hi>Waſtes</hi> as that he has left, but juſt ſufficient for his <hi>Common Feeding</hi> in ſuch Caſe the <hi>Lord</hi> ought to be excluded of <hi>Feeding;</hi> but this muſt be ſhewn in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, according to my <hi>Lord Coke's</hi> Opinion, in <hi>Kenwrick and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giters Caſe,</hi> which is well reported in <hi>Brownlow 2 part 64, 65.</hi> And in all reaſon there muſt be <hi>Special Pleading</hi> in ſuch Caſe, for where a <hi>Preſcription</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is reaſonable only upon <hi>Special Matter</hi> or <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> that <hi>Special Matter</hi> or <hi>Circumſtance</hi> muſt be ſhewn to the <hi>Court,</hi> by him that would have the advantage of the <hi>Preſcription,</hi> for the <hi>Negative</hi> cannot be averred on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>And it cannot be helped, by ſuppoſing there may be <hi>Trees, Mines</hi> or <hi>Park,</hi> but it ought to be ſhewn; for every thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon ſuppoſition, may as well not be as be, and to allow a <hi>Preſcription</hi> upon ſuch a ſuppoſal, would be to bind up a party by it tho' the thing be not; and <hi>Paſturage</hi> may well be ſuppoſed, the whole profit of <hi>Paſture Ground,</hi> for it is ſo in fact in many places, and has its name, becauſe it is fed all the year. But Where it is fed but part of the year, and mowed or plowed the reſt, it is called <hi>Arable or Meadow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The main Objection that I conceive they can make to this is, That the <hi>Sole Paſturage or Veſture</hi> lies in <hi>Grant,</hi> and the Owner may exclude himſelf wholly by <hi>Grant,</hi> and ſo he may be excluded by <hi>Preſcription</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and this they ground upon <hi>Co. Litt. 4, b.</hi> where it is ſaid, if a Man Grants to another, and his <hi>Heirs veſturam terrae,</hi> and makes Livery <hi>ſecundum formam Chartae;</hi> yet the <hi>Freehold</hi> of the <hi>Soil</hi> ſhall not paſs; by which it is implied, that the <hi>Veſture</hi> ſhall.</p>
                     <p>If this <hi>Book</hi> be to be underſtood of the <hi>Veſture</hi> at all times of the year, where no other profits remain to the <hi>Lord,</hi> I ſhall crave leave to object againſt it from the ſame Page, where it is agréed, that if it were profits, the <hi>Soil</hi> would paſs.</p>
                     <p>Methinks it ſhould be the ſame in reaſon, where the <hi>Veſture</hi> is all the profits, and <hi>Veſture</hi> ſhall be intended all the profits. I ſhall cite ſome Authorities, which are not inconſiderable to Warrant this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="393" facs="tcp:51792:198"/>I have in a <hi>Manuſcript Report</hi> of Caſes in <hi>King James's</hi> time, a Caſe betwixt <hi>Collins</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Oxford;</hi> It was <hi>Paſchae 19. Jacobi</hi> upon a <hi>Tryal</hi> at <hi>Bar</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> The Caſe was, that <hi>1 Ed. 6.</hi> the <hi>King</hi> erects the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and gave to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and his <hi>Succeſſors, int' al' primam veſturam</hi> of a <hi>Meadow</hi> called <hi>Horſe Meadow.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Kelway 118.</hi> If a Man Grants <hi>veſturam Terrae</hi> for term of Life to another, it is a Grant of the <hi>Land</hi> for Life; for ſaith the <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>veſture</hi> is the profit of the <hi>Land,</hi> and it is all one to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit as to have the <hi>Land</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Littleton</hi> puts the Caſe, if a Man Grants the <hi>Veſture</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> to another and his <hi>Heirs,</hi> without <hi>Livery,</hi> no <hi>Eſtate</hi> paſſeth.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Book</hi> of my <hi>Lord Cokes</hi> difference, betwixt the <hi>Veſture</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the profits of the <hi>Land</hi> ſeems to be miſtaken, and in reaſon they are the ſame; for I take it generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Veſture</hi> ſhall be intended all the profits, and if there be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial profits, as <hi>Mines</hi> opened, or <hi>Waters, &amp;c.</hi> which may qualifie the word, and retain the <hi>Soil</hi> to the Owner, it muſt be ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>And as it is for <hi>Veſture</hi> of <hi>Land,</hi> ſo I conceive where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Pleading that the <hi>Ground</hi> is <hi>Paſture.

Partition 21.</hi> Two <hi>Men</hi> agree to make parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Paſture Ground</hi> in this manner, That one ſhall have <hi>totam paſturam,</hi> from ſuch a time to ſuch a time, and the other for the reſidue of the year; this is a partition of the <hi>Soil</hi> it ſelf, which ſhews <hi>Paſture</hi> is to be intended the whole profits of <hi>Paſture Ground;</hi> in that caſe the <hi>quo jure</hi> could not be maintained, for the party had not barely a <hi>Liberty,</hi> but the <hi>Soil</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="394" facs="tcp:51792:199"/>If ſeveral <hi>Men</hi> have Profits upon the ſame <hi>Land, alternis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus,</hi> the Law moſt commonly determines the right of the <hi>Soil</hi> to be in him, that has the moſt conſiderable Profits. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>If one has the <hi>Summer Feeding</hi> of <hi>Paſture,</hi> or the firſt <hi>Tonſure</hi> of <hi>Meadow,</hi> or the <hi>Sowing</hi> and <hi>Reaping</hi> of <hi>Corn</hi> upon <hi>Arable,</hi> and an other <hi>Man</hi> has the <hi>Feeding</hi> ſeparately at other times of the year; the <hi>Law</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Soil</hi> is in him that has the <hi>Summer profits</hi> and <hi>Corn,</hi> becauſe it is the greater Profits, and the other hath but a Profit <hi>a prender.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, ſuppoſe that two <hi>Men</hi> have interchangeably the ſole <hi>Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Paſture</hi> at ſuch times, that the intereſt of one is in all reſpects equal to that of the other, there nothing can determin the <hi>Soil</hi> to be in one more than the other; and therefore it ſhall be in one for his time, and in the other for his time. But where one has the ſole feeding of <hi>Paſture</hi> at all times in the year, and it has been ſo time out of mind, and there is nothing but <hi>Paſture,</hi> what can the other have to ſhew the <hi>Soil</hi> to be in him, and why ſhould it not be ſaid to be in him that has the Feeding or whole Profits? It ſeems very abſurd, that a <hi>Man</hi> ſhould be allowed to be <hi>Owner</hi> of the <hi>Soil,</hi> and yet it may be has no badge of <hi>Ownerſhip</hi> by <hi>Perception</hi> of Profits. If the <hi>Mans Eſtate</hi> be diſplaced ſo as to be put to a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> how ſhould he lay the <hi>Eſplees?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as to this Conſideration there may be difference betwixt a Grand and Vſage, for a Grant beginning within time of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the <hi>Ownerſhip</hi> of the <hi>Soil</hi> was once fully manifeſted, until he had diveſted himſelf of all but that; but upon Vſage time out of mind nothing can be ſaid, why one <hi>Man</hi> ſhould have the <hi>Soil</hi> more than another if it be not in him that hath all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
                     <p>I muſt end this Point alſo with this Obſervation, That if there is no Caſe in all the <hi>Books</hi> of a <hi>Sole Paſture</hi> at all times of the year, but in <hi>F. N. tit.

                     </p>
                     <p>My fourth Reaſon upon which I hold this <hi>Preſcription</hi> is void, is, becauſe it is a new invention framed to overthrow a <hi>Maxim</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and is of miſchievous conſequence.</p>
                     <p>New inventions that are agreeable to <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> I know have been always received, and ſometimes have proved of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe. But New inventions that are framed to ſupplant Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Law,</hi> have been always baffled and rejected.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Maxim</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> that is overturned by this way of Pleading is, <hi>That a Commoner cannot preſcribe to exclude his Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="395" facs="tcp:51792:448"/>This <hi>Maxim</hi> is one of the foundations of <hi>Law,</hi> and depends upon the reaſon of the thing, and not upon the ſound of the word.</p>
                     <p>It will be objected, that the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>ex vi termini</hi> the word <hi>Common</hi> implies that they are to Common with the <hi>Lord,</hi> which they cannot do if the <hi>Lord</hi> does not feed.</p>
                     <p>But I conceive it is not ſo, for it may be as well called a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> without a <hi>Soleciſm,</hi> where the <hi>Tenants</hi> feed in common to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the <hi>Lord</hi> never feeds with them, as where he does; the true reaſon is from the nature of the thing, for it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Lord</hi> has no need of his <hi>Waſte,</hi> and to make <hi>non-uſage</hi> in ſuch a caſe turn to a Preſcription or Cuſtom againſt him, would be moſt unreaſonable.</p>
                     <p>Vpon the creation of <hi>Mannors,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> took as much as was for their own <hi>Uſe</hi> into their <hi>Demeſns,</hi> they diſtributed as much as was convenient amongſt their <hi>Tenants;</hi> what was left was called the <hi>Lords Waſte,</hi> which was neglected by the <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe he had before taken into his <hi>Demeſns</hi> what he had need of.</p>
                     <p>It were very hard, that <hi>non-uſage</hi> ſhould turn to a Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe he doth not feed his <hi>Waſtes,</hi> when he left them waſte before, becauſe he had taken as much before as he had occaſion to feed.</p>
                     <p>It is upon the ſame reaſon that the <hi>Law</hi> will not allow any Preſcription for <hi>Commoners</hi> to exclude, and not upon any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the word <hi>Common. Maxims</hi> in <hi>Law</hi> do not depend upon words, but upon foundations of reaſon; it is not for the honour of the <hi>Law</hi> that it ſhould have its <hi>Maxims</hi> depend upon ſounds and words, and not upon ſolid reaſon.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Commoners</hi> cannot preſcribe to exclude their <hi>Lords</hi> if they call their Right by the term of <hi>Common;</hi> but if they call it by another name, tho' they claim the ſame kind of intereſt, they may exclude them.</p>
                     <p>If you preſcribe to have <hi>Communiam excludendo Dom'</hi> that is not good; but if you preſcribe to have <hi>ſolam &amp; ſeparalem Paſtur'</hi> in common amongſt your ſelves for Beaſts <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Couchant,</hi> you may exclude him.</p>
                     <p>Vnder favour, to have ſuch a <hi>Maxim</hi> turned out of Doors and made Vſeleſs, there ought to be very good Authority for it; ſuch an Invention ought to be examined by ſtrict Rules.</p>
                     <p>And the conſequence of this Innovation will be great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for there is no <hi>Common</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but this Plea will ſerve, for if the Iury will find it; and it is found by experience, that many times, though the <hi>Lord of the Mannor</hi> gives very good Evidence, a Iury will find againſt him; and if a <hi>Lord</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove an actual feeding, a Iury will certainly incline to find it, let the Court direct what they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="396" facs="tcp:51792:449"/>The <hi>King</hi> and great <hi>Lords,</hi> that have large <hi>Waſtes,</hi> that lie remote from their care, ſeldom made any benefit by feeding; and they muſt not expect hereafter to make any improvements, if this pleading be allowed, which will be very miſchievous; whereas, if that <hi>Maxim of Law</hi> were obſerved, and ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Claim diſallowed in Pleading, it will not be in the power of Iuries to exclude <hi>Lords</hi> out of their own <hi>Waſtes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conceive, in this Caſe, upon the matter diſcloſed, in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Court may diſcern judicially, that this is but an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Artifice to diſguiſe a <hi>Common,</hi> and to call it a <hi>Sole-paſture</hi> to enable the <hi>Commoners</hi> to preſcribe to exclude the <hi>Lord,</hi> which they cannot directly do by the Rules of <hi>Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here firſt, The <hi>Soil</hi> is the <hi>Lords of the Mannor,</hi> and a parcel of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> and a large quantity in truth <hi>10000</hi> Acres, tho' the place aſſigned is but <hi>100</hi> Acres.</p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Free-holders</hi> and <hi>Copy-holders</hi> of ancient Houſes, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> are to feed and not to be excluded, and in truth of <hi>3,</hi> or <hi>4</hi> Meſſuages in the Town.</p>
                     <p>'Tis for Beaſts <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Couchant,</hi> 'tis with an exception of <hi>Hoggs, Sheep</hi> and <hi>Northern Steers,</hi> which is like the regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Common;</hi> if it were a <hi>Sole-paſture</hi> they might have put in what Cattle they pleaſed, for it is all one to the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is to be wholly excluded.</p>
                     <p>The Court may diſcern by all theſe Badges, that it is in its nature but a <hi>Common,</hi> by Art put into other words to ouſt the <hi>Lord.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſhall now crave leave to offer to the view of the Court the Conſequences and Inconveniences of this Preſcription.</hi>

                     <p>If on the contrary, the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall feed, muſt he do it as the Owner of the <hi>Soil,</hi> and have the <hi>Surpluſage?</hi> for the <hi>Levancy</hi> and <hi>Couchancy,</hi> is not material among themſelves. And then they would become as Commoners again; and this would be a ſtrange Preſcription, that cannot be maintained if ever there were any <hi>Eſcheat</hi> of any <hi>Tenancy</hi> into the <hi>Lords</hi> hands.</p>

                        <hi>4.</hi> But the greateſt miſchief of all will be, that this will be a ready way to enable Tenants to withſtand all Improvements. In <hi>Gatewards Caſe, 6 Co. 60.</hi> it was a great reaſon againſt a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, that it was inconſiſtent with any improvement; it would be a great miſchief to this Kingdom where there are large <hi>Waſtes</hi> and <hi>Commons, Forreſts</hi> and <hi>Fenns,</hi> to take away all power of improving them; for the ſame Land by improvement becomes able to ſupport a great number of people which are the ſtrength of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And as there are great inconveniences on this ſide, ſo the other way there will be none at all, for they may enjoy the ſame <hi>Uſages</hi> as Commoners; if they preſcribe the ordinary way, and the <hi>Lord</hi> cannot do them any prejudice at all, he can only take the <hi>Surpluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> leaving them ſufficient; if he feeds to their damage, it will be a Surcharge, and an Action upon the Caſe will lie againſt him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> cannot improve but he muſt leave them ſufficent, and there can be no reaſon why the Owner ſhould not have the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage</hi> if any be.</p>
                     <p>I know they will cite an Authority againſt me in the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Webb</hi> and <hi>Littleburgh,</hi> which was in <hi>C. B. 1654.</hi> There, I confeſs, the Declaration was grounded upon a Preſcription much like to this, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had a Verdict, and the Court would not arreſt Iudgment upon it.</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer that I muſt give to that Caſe is grounded upon the difference between a <hi>Demurrer</hi> and a <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Court may intend that after a <hi>Verdict,</hi> which may help it; for I allow an excluſion of the <hi>Lord</hi> upon a Special Caſe diſcloſed in pleading, and that Special Matter may be ſupplied by the <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides I muſt obſerve, that it was a Caſe of ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that concerned the <hi>Lord</hi> only for his Coſts, for he hath enjoyed his feeding againſt that <hi>Verdict</hi> ever ſince: I can ſay it upon my own knowledge; for I know the Parties, and know the Place, it was at <hi>Elinſwell</hi> near <hi>Bury St. Edmonds</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> The Iudges liſten to Exceptions after a <hi>Verdict,</hi> but will give <hi>Judgment</hi> if there be any poſſibility to maintain it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is a new and unheard of way of Pleading, and againſt the Rule of <hi>Law,</hi> joyning <hi>Freehold Tenants,</hi> in the generalty, which have no relation one to another, and annexing an entire Intereſt to ſeveral Eſtates, and mixing Preſcription and Cuſtom, which are of contrary Natures and are great Abſurdities.</p>
                     <p>It is againſt Reaſon to ouſt the Owner of all the feeding, which for ought appears is all the Profits, without any Special Matter or Recompence appearing in Pleading.</p>
                     <p>There is great inconvenience in admitting of ſuch a Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, new Inventions bringing unknown Conſequences.</p>
                     <p>No inconvenience in ouſting <hi>Tenants</hi> of this Preſcription, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they claim the ſame <hi>Uſage</hi> the ordinary way, and the <hi>Lord</hi> can do them no wrong either by feeding or improvement.</p>
                     <p>In this Caſe the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> had been divided in Opinion upon the Matter in <hi>Law,</hi> as appears by <hi>Vaughans</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; and therefore Sir <hi>Henry North</hi> thought not fit to wave the Matter of <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> altho' he had ſo good a Caſe upon the Fact, that if it had been no prejudice he would joyn <hi>Iſſue</hi> and try the truth of this Preſcription at the Bar; whereupon the <hi>Demurrer</hi> was by conſent waved, and the Cauſe tried at the Bar, and the <hi>Verdict</hi> paſſed for Sir <hi>Henry North,</hi> with the approbation of the whole Court.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards another Action was brought to trial in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> at the Bar, and it appearing to the Court that there had been Propoſals towards an Agreement, a <hi>Juror</hi> was withdrawn, and my <hi>Lord Chief Baron Hale</hi> gave the <hi>Tenants</hi> advice to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this, ſaying <hi>Redime te captum quam queas minimo.</hi>

                     <p>I take it to be clear that <hi>Retorn' brevium</hi> did not paſs by the Patent of King <hi>John;</hi> there is indeed ſome implication of ſuch a <hi>Franchiſe,</hi> but it is nothing like a <hi>Grant</hi> of it. 'Tis true, we muſt put that Expoſition upon Ancient <hi>Charters,</hi> as ſhould have been put in thoſe days wherein they were made: But I ſay, this <hi>Patent</hi> would not have been expounded to have amounted to ſuch a <hi>Grant in diebus illis.</hi> If there had been an <hi>Uſage</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe</hi> in purſuance of this Patent (tho' made ſince <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt's time) I think it might have been allowed to have given the Return of <hi>Writs, Vid. 2 Inſt. 282.</hi> But here has been no ſuch <hi>Uſage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, in the Patent of <hi>E. 3.</hi> it is recited, that there was an <hi>Uſage,</hi> and that the <hi>Franchiſe</hi> was granted by <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, and confirmed by King <hi>John;</hi> but the <hi>Juries</hi> finding of that Patent, is no finding of the things recited in it, as in the <hi>10 Co. 56. q.</hi> the finding of <hi>Evidence</hi> of a <hi>Converſion, (ſcil.

Ordaining, <hi>That henceforth all the Wapentakes and Hundreds, which were ſevered from the Counties, ſhould be rejoyned to the ſame Counties, as before that time had been eſtabliſhed by another Statute,</hi> (meaning, I ſuppoſe, the ſaid <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>2 E. 3. cap. 12.</hi>) And thereupon my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the <hi>4 Inſt. 267.</hi> gives his Opinion, That all the <hi>Grants</hi> made of the <hi>Bailywicks</hi> of <hi>Hundreds</hi> ſince this <hi>Statute</hi> are void, and that the making the <hi>Bayliffs</hi> thereof belong to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> for the better Execution of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and of his <hi>Office.</hi> And for that he cites a <hi>Reſolution</hi> in his own Caſe; for he it was that was the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Bucks,</hi> mentioned in the Caſe there. <hi>Fitzh. Petition 1. 18 E. 3.</hi> is a Caſe of a man, who by colour of the <hi>New Statute</hi> 'tis ſaid was ouſted of his liberty of <hi>Retorna Brevium,</hi> which was granted to him and his <hi>Heirs</hi> by the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi> My Brother <hi>Littleton</hi> cited a good Opinion of three <hi>Judges,</hi> that an <hi>Hundred</hi> could not be granted without a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the <hi>Statute,</hi> and here is no <hi>Non obſtante.</hi> Now a man cannot have the Return of <hi>Writs</hi> without the <hi>Hundred. Vid. 2. Inſt. 452. 2. H. 4. pl. 12.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But admitting it did paſs, and was granted before the <hi>Statute,</hi> then the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not extend to avoid that Grant. But then the Queſtion will be, when the <hi>Liberties</hi> return to the <hi>Crown, Whether the Crown can grant them out again?</hi> And therein it will be conſiderable, <hi>Whether they are extinct in the Crown, or no?</hi> I think they are not extinct. In <hi>9 Co. 25. b.</hi> 'tis ſaid, that all <hi>Liberties, Franchiſes, &amp;c.</hi> which were at firſt created and erected by the <hi>King,</hi> and were not <hi>Liberties, &amp;c.</hi> in the hands of the <hi>King</hi> as Flowers of the <hi>Crown,</hi> are not by their acceſſion to the King drowned in the <hi>Crown;</hi> and there <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Leets</hi> are inſtanced in and allowed to be ſuch. And now the Liberty of <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> is more ſtrongly ſuch; for that all <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> (of which <hi>Hundreds, &amp;c.</hi> are a Branch) were once in the <hi>Crown:</hi> But <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> is but a Miniſterial thing. It is expreſly Adjudged in the <hi>Kings-Bench, Keilway 72. pl. 16.</hi> that the Liberties of <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> are not extinct by coming to the <hi>Kings</hi> hands. But however, if they were or were not extinct and drowned, I think that they could not (becauſe of the <hi>Statute</hi>) be ſevered and granted to <hi>Kingſton.</hi>

                     <p>I ſhall be ſomewhat long, becauſe the Caſe is very Intricate, and requires an Explication of many things.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place I ſhall explain three <hi>Terms</hi> in the Caſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> The <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of <hi>Cirenceſter.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> An <hi>Hundred.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, Retorna Brevium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a little Hiſtorically, to ſhew the traduction and derivation of this Matter. It was a <hi>Monaſtery</hi> time out of Mind; but in <hi>30 H. 1.</hi> it was tranſlated to the <hi>Canons Regular;</hi> and therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> is accounted the Founder, he Endowed it with three <hi>Hides</hi> of Land. <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt gave them the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> and the <hi>Seven Hundreds,</hi> at the Farm of <hi>30 l per annum.</hi> The Charter of <hi>Exemption</hi> (mentioned in the <hi>Verdit</hi>) was made by King <hi>John,</hi> who Confirmed the Grant of <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt at the ſame Farm. This you ſhall find in <hi>Chartae Antiquae</hi> Letter <hi>G.</hi> (for the Book goes by Letters) Number <hi>9,</hi> and the Letter <hi>M.</hi> in Number <hi>12.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The next thing to be conſidered is an <hi>Hundred.</hi> Of old time <hi>Hundreds</hi> were parcel of the <hi>Crown,</hi> belonging of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right to the <hi>King, 11 H. 6. 89. pl. 44.</hi> by the Grant of an <hi>Hundred</hi> there did not paſs only a Liberty, which had a <hi>Court</hi> and alſo commonly a <hi>Leet,</hi> which is called the <hi>Leet</hi> of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:</hi> But there was alſo an implied Power of making a <hi>Bayliff:</hi> The <hi>Bayliff</hi> had a double Office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> He had the Collection of <hi>Perquiſites, Amerciaments, Fees, Ancient Duties,</hi> as <hi>Beupleader, Head, Silver, &amp;c.</hi> belonging to the <hi>Hundreds</hi> in ſome places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He had another Office and that was relating to the <hi>Sheriff.</hi> In Ancient time the <hi>Bayliffs</hi> of the <hi>Hundreds</hi> were the immediate <hi>Bayliffs</hi> of the King for the Execution of <hi>Proceſs. Vid.</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> made at <hi>Lincoln 9 Ed. 2. the ſecond Statute;</hi> there 'tis ſaid, that the Execution of <hi>Writs</hi> that come to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> ſhall be done by <hi>Hundredors,</hi> (<hi>i. e. Lords,</hi> or rather <hi>Bayliffs</hi> of the <hi>Hundred</hi>) ſworn and known in the full <hi>County, &amp;c.</hi> which is Confirmed <hi>2 E. 3. cap. 4.</hi> and <hi>14 E. 3. cap. 9.</hi> This thing of Farming out <hi>Hundreds</hi> to perſons thus, grew to be a great Inconvenience: For the <hi>Hundreds</hi> which were of the <hi>County,</hi> and did belong to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> there was no Inconvenience; the <hi>Sheriff</hi> did ſometimes Account as <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> ſometimes <hi>per Manus.</hi> Then thoſe many Proviſions were made, <hi>viz. 2 E. 3. cap. 12.</hi> whereas

all the <hi>Counties</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were in Old time Aſſeſſed to a certain <hi>Farm;</hi> and then were all the <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes</hi> in the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Hand rated to this <hi>Farm,</hi> and after were <hi>Approvers</hi> ſent into divers <hi>Counties,</hi> which did increaſe the <hi>Farms</hi> of ſome <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes.</hi> And after the <hi>Kings</hi> at divers times have granted to many men part of the ſame <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes</hi> for the old <hi>Farms</hi> only. And now of late the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> are wholly charged of the Increaſe, which amounteth to a great Sum, to the great hurt of the <hi>People</hi> and ditheriſon of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and their <hi>Heirs.</hi> It is Ordained, that the <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes</hi> ſet to Farm by the King that now is, be it for <hi>Term of Life</hi> or otherwiſe, which were ſometimes annexed to the <hi>Farms</hi> of the <hi>Counties</hi> where the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> be charged, ſhall be adjoyned again to the <hi>Counties,</hi> and that the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and their <hi>Heirs</hi> have Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the <hi>Time</hi> that is paſt, and that from henceforth ſuch <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes</hi> ſhall not be given nor ſevered from the <hi>Counties.</hi> Then <hi>14 E. 3. cap. 4.</hi> Whereas many Miſchiefs be happened throughout the <hi>Realm,</hi> for that <hi>Sheriffs</hi> have lett the <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes</hi> to a higher <hi>Farm</hi> than they do yield to the King, and the <hi>Farmers</hi> do lett the ſame to others at higher and greater Sums in ſuch manner, that by the letting and enhancing of the <hi>Farms,</hi> and by the greater number of <hi>Bayliffs Errants, Outriders</hi> and others, whom the <hi>Sheriffs Bayliffs</hi> and <hi>Hundredors</hi> do put in, the <hi>People</hi> be in divers manners charged and grieved: It is aſſented and accorded, That from henceforth all the <hi>Wapentakes</hi> and <hi>Hundreds</hi> which be ſevered from the <hi>Counties,</hi> ſhall be rejoyned to the ſame <hi>Counties,</hi> as before this time hath been eſtabliſhed by another <hi>Statute,</hi> and that the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> hold the ſame in their own Hands, and put in ſuch <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and <hi>Hundredors,</hi> having Lands within the ſame <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and <hi>Hundreds</hi> for whom they will Anſwer: And if they will Lett any <hi>Hundreds, Bayli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> or <hi>Wapentakes</hi> to Farm, they ſhall lett the ſame at the ancient Farm without any thing increaſing, and that the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> be ſerved by ſuch <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and <hi>Hundredors,</hi> and their <hi>Under Bayliffs,</hi> in avoiding for ever the <hi>Outriders</hi> and others, which in divers <hi>Counties</hi> before this time have notoriouſly grieved the <hi>People:</hi> And that no <hi>Bayliff Errant</hi> be but in the <hi>County</hi> where <hi>Bayliffs Errants</hi> have been in times paſt, in the time of the <hi>King</hi>'s Grandfather that now is, and that there be no more but one <hi>Bayliff Errant</hi> in one <hi>County:</hi> And in the ſame manner it is aſſented, That all other, of what Eſtate or Condition they be, which have <hi>Bayliwicks</hi> or <hi>Hundreds</hi> in Fee, if they the ſame will hold in their own Hands, then they ſhall put in ſuch <hi>Bayliffs</hi> for whom they will Anſwer; and if they will lett the ſame in <hi>Farm</hi> to other, then they ſhall lett the ſame at the <hi>ancient Farm</hi> without any thing increaſing, as aforeſaid is ſaid, &amp;c.

For the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> did Farm at a certain Rate, and did Account for it in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and this was called <hi>Firma Balliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It was found that a great Inconvenience grew from the ſevering of <hi>Hundreds</hi> from the <hi>Counties.</hi> The <hi>Statute</hi> intended that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſhould execute <hi>Writs, &amp;c.</hi> and it was unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that he ſhould have <hi>Bayliffs</hi> put upon him, and yet be bound to Execute, &amp;c. therefore the Statute intended to reconcile this as far as it could well, and to reſtore as many of the <hi>Hundreds</hi> as could well be, to the <hi>Sheriff.</hi>

                     <p>This is a ſuperadded Liberty; tho' the <hi>Hundreds</hi> were granted, yet the <hi>Sheriff</hi> might and muſt ſtill Return the <hi>Writs</hi> executed there. This Liberty was commonly annexed to the Grants of <hi>Hundreds,</hi> tho' ſometimes of <hi>Mannors</hi> it is acquirable by Grant, and (I think) by Preſcription, tho' that has been a Doubt: But <hi>8 H. 4. c. 7. pl. 10.</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> by Preſcription,<note place="margin">Vid.

                     <p>But the <hi>Preſcription</hi> was naught, becauſe it was applied only to the Return of the <hi>Writs</hi> of the <hi>Queen:</hi> For he laid a <hi>Preſcption</hi> (in the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi>) to have <hi>Retorna omnium Brevium Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptorum &amp; Mandatorum dictae Dom' Reginae,</hi> and ſays not of her <hi>Predeceſſors;</hi> and it is plainly impoſſible, that a man ſhould have time out of mind the <hi>Return</hi> of the <hi>Queens Writs,</hi> when the <hi>Queen</hi> began her Reign within time of Memory.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> carries in it (by Implication) the <hi>Execution of Writs,</hi> tho' it be not expreſs, as in the laſt preceding Caſe, where after the Words above mentioned is added, <hi>&amp; Executionem eorundem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="406" facs="tcp:51792:203"/>And ſo it was Adjudged in the Caſe of the <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Warwick againſt Atwood, Paſch. 41 Eliz. Rot. 331. B.R.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Liberty, tho' it carries an <hi>Exemption,</hi> yet it doth not exclude, but that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> may execute <hi>Writs</hi> within it. But then it is a Wrong, for which the Lord of the <hi>Liberty</hi> may have his Action: But in ſome Caſes the <hi>Sheriff</hi> may lawfully do it, as in the Caſe of the <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Non omittas, &amp;c.</hi> in caſe of Execution of a <hi>Writ of Waſte,</hi> whereto he is particularly Empower'd by the Statute, and ſometimes where the <hi>Thing is divided, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ſhall add no more concerning this, but only ſay,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Liberty of <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> is a dangerous Liberty for him that hath it; for he is to be Reſponſible for all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of his <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> as <hi>Eſcapes, &amp;c.</hi> And if the <hi>Bayliff</hi> do not Account for the Collection of the <hi>King's Revenue, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis a <hi>Feather in his Cap,</hi> but a <hi>Thorn in his Foot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis much derogatory to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> For the party muſt go to the <hi>Sheriff</hi> firſt, then to the <hi>Bayliff, &amp;c.</hi> and by this means <hi>Juſtice</hi> is delayed and diſappointed.</p>
                     <p>There are two <hi>Liberties</hi> do abundantly more hurt than they are worth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Grants of <hi>Fines,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Jurors,</hi> and this of <hi>Retorna Brevium:</hi> Therefore <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, a moſt Wiſe Prince, Declared in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and it was Recorded in the <hi>Courts, That he would not grant it.</hi> This you will find in the <hi>Pleas</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, towards the latter End, in Mr. <hi>Ryley.</hi> The Paſſage meant is in <hi>Placita Parliamentaria 35 Ed. 1. fol. 366.</hi> in Mr. <hi>Ryley,</hi> it is this,
<q xml:lang="fre">Praeceptum Domini Regis, LE Roy ad Dit &amp; Commande, Quod apres ceſt Grant qu'il ad fait al un Counte de <hi>Nicole,</hi> de Return de Brief avoir, en deux Hundreds à terme de la vie du dit Counte, le Roy ne voet doner ne granter a nulluy tiel Franchiſe tant come le Roy vivera, s'il ne ſoit a ſes Enfantes demeſne, &amp; ceo voet le Roy que ſoit Eſcrit en le <hi>Chancellerie,</hi> en <hi>Gardrobe,</hi> &amp; al <hi>Eſchequer.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Grant of this Liberty was within a certain <hi>Precinct,</hi> and could not extend to a <hi>County, 2 H. 4.</hi> For as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> obſerves on <hi>W. 2. cap. 39. 2 Inſt. 452.</hi> A Grant to have Return of <hi>Writs</hi> in a <hi>County</hi> is void; for in effect it taketh away the Office of a <hi>Sheriff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By that time I have applied theſe <hi>Obſervations,</hi> I ſhall in effect have done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be Conſidered, Whether the <hi>Charters</hi> of King <hi>John</hi> did Create the Return of <hi>Writs,</hi> or no? ſeeing there are only
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:51792:203"/>
Negative, no Poſitive Words in it. Somewhat may be ſaid to maintain this to be a good Grant of <hi>Retorna Brevium,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contrary has been admitted, I will admit it too, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe the ſcope of the Patent was, that the <hi>Abbot</hi> ſhould be <hi>immediate Officer to the King;</hi> and the intention of the <hi>Charter</hi> was to exclude the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and that does appear by the concluſion, where an Exception is made of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Power of medling <hi>per Summonitionem, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo it is like the Caſe of the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> in <hi>5 Jacobi,</hi> a Grant to them that they ſhould be a <hi>County,</hi> but no Grant of having a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> was adjudged to be void, becauſe there would be no Officer to execute and do Iuſtice. I do obſerve that <hi>13 Ed. 3.</hi> in the <hi>Iter</hi> there was an Information againſt this <hi>Abbot,</hi> and he pleaded the <hi>Charter of R. 1.</hi> but there is nothing of <hi>Retorn of Writs</hi> that I can find, and I have read the Book over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We come to conſider the Grant of <hi>E. 3.</hi> I ſay,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> It is a good Grant of <hi>Retorna Brevium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> There is a good annexation of it to the <hi>Hundreds</hi> by reaſon of theſe words <hi>tanquam pertinent' Hundredis predict',</hi> for even at this day ſuch a thing as <hi>Common of Eſtovers, &amp;c.</hi> may be granted appurtenant. <hi>Sacheverell againſt Porter, 13 Car. 1. 1 Cro. 482. 1 Rolls 400. 11. H. 6. 11 Pl. 27.</hi> Now then by this <hi>Patent</hi> here is a <hi>Retorna Brevium,</hi> not only newly created, but newly created appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and eſpecially ſince here is a kind of cognation between the things, this may very well be; in like manner may Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of Pleas be granted, if the King ſhould grant that a <hi>Lord of an Hundred</hi> ſhould have <hi>cognitionem omnium placitorum, &amp;c. tanquam pertinent' Hundred', &amp;c.</hi> it would create Cogniſance of Pleas appurtenant to the <hi>Hundred;</hi> for it being a Creature of the Kings it may be created as he pleaſes, either in groſs or as appurtenant; for a thing appurtenant may be by Grant, though a thing appendant muſt be by Preſcription.</p>
                     <p>Well now, this <hi>Abbot</hi> is ſeiſed of this Liberty <hi>quodammodo</hi> appurtenant.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> When the <hi>Monaſtery, &amp;c.</hi> comes to be diſſolved and given to the King, it is to be conſidered what becomes of this Liberty then? I conceive this Liberty is in the hands of the King, as it was in the hands of the <hi>Abbot, (viz.)</hi> as appurtenant, and that without the aid of the <hi>Statute of 32 H. 8. c. 20.</hi> It is adjudged <hi>Keil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way 72. Pl. 16.</hi> that this Liberty of <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> when it comes to the King, remains in the Crown, and is not extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rejoyned or drowned thereby.</p>
                     <p>And this Liberty is not by this coming to the Crown, rean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the County, but if that were a Queſtion, the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> hath put it out of queſtion, for by that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it is in the ſame ſtate that it was before. 'Tis true, the King
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:51792:204"/>
might rejoyn it to the County, but till he does, it continues a Liberty diſtinct, an Hundred in groſs, and the <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſhall write <hi>Ballivo Dom' Regis, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true, if a man forfeit ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by <hi>non uſer</hi> or <hi>miſ uſer,</hi> the <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſhall enter into it, and to, and execute as in other parts of the County, becauſe in that caſe the King comes in in <hi>diſaffirmance</hi> of the Liberty, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is where the King comes in under a Subject, as in the <hi>Bar caſe</hi> he does.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We come to conſider what alteration is made in the Caſe by the Grant to <hi>Seymour</hi> and his Attainder: As to this I muſt obſerve, that the <hi>Verdict</hi> is ill found, for 'tis <hi>conceſſit, &amp;c. Dom' Seymour, &amp;c.</hi> but not found what <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and here is a breaking off in the middle, of which we cannot tell what to make. Now when the King Grants, and expreſſes no <hi>Eſtate,</hi> ſome Books have held the Grant to be void; but the better Opinion is, that it creates an <hi>Eſtate</hi> at will, <hi>5 E. 4. 8.</hi> (the laſt Leaf) <hi>B. Pl. 1.</hi> but <hi>17 E. 3. 45. Pl. 46.</hi> is expreſs in it,<note place="margin">Davis 45, 45.</note> and ſo it was adjudged <hi>Paſchae 8. Jacobi in Petſall's Caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why then the conſequence will be, that by the Attainder the <hi>Will</hi> was determined, and then the King was in of his Old Reverſion, and then the <hi>Statute of 32 H. 8.</hi> ſerved well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Liberty in the ſame <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſtill. But if the Grant were in <hi>Fee,</hi> then the King came in by a New Title, <hi>viz. the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and then there is no benefit of the ſaid <hi>Statute;</hi> ſo that this Error in the <hi>Verdict</hi> is moſt to the diſadvantage of the Party (the <hi>Defendant.</hi>) who would not amend it; for there was a Propoſal and Diſcourſe of amending, and ſome things were amended; but the amending of this Miſtake would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by the <hi>Defendant.</hi> But to ſuppoſe this to be a <hi>Grant in Fee,</hi> I ſay ſtill it ſtood of it ſelf a Liberty without the <hi>Statute,</hi> and ſo when it returned to the Crown by Attainder, it ſtood not in need of any ſuch <hi>Statute,</hi> it was <hi>Subſtantive</hi> and not <hi>melted down</hi> in a <hi>General Confuſion</hi> into the Form whence it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Come we now to the Grant to <hi>Kingſton:</hi> It has many Clauſes in it, I will inſiſt upon two.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> The King Grants <hi>Omnia Amerciamenta, &amp;c.</hi> with large words, <hi>Cognita, Reputata, Acceptata, &amp;c.</hi> I did ſay that the Grant of <hi>E. 3.</hi> made an annexation of this Liberty of <hi>Ret' Brev.</hi> to the Hundreds; and if we ſhould admit that, it were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to create an appurtenancy in reputation; and if it were no more than ſo, theſe words would lay hold on it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> The other Clauſe I will reſt upon; thereby the King grants <hi>tot talia &amp; tanta, &amp;c.</hi> as any, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had <hi>ratione vel praetextu Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred' praedict' virtute praetextu, vel colore alicujus Doni, Chartae, &amp;c.</hi> Now certainly the latter words are ſubſervient and ancil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:51792:204"/>
and the <hi>ratione vel praetextu Hundredi</hi> governs all, for it is but one entire Sentence, like <hi>Finches Caſe, 6 Co. 39.</hi> This <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textu</hi> is a very large Clauſe and much more than <hi>tot talia &amp; tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> wherefore I conclude, that it is a good and ſufficient Grant of the thing in Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Three Objections have been made, to which I ſhall endeavour to give Anſwers.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>1. By the coming to the Crown the Liberty is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> It is not.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Admit it were merged thereby, yet that is not till the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Why now in this laſt Grant there is a <hi>Retroſpect,</hi> and it is with a leaping over to the <hi>Seiſin</hi> which the <hi>Abbot</hi> had, and therefore the Grant of the King conjoyning it to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Abbot,</hi> the Liberty is effectually revived and erected in the ſame manner and condition as it was before the uniting of it to the Crown.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>2. If this Liberty be to be revived, yet 'tis not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivable without Special Words; in the Grant to <hi>Seymour</hi> there are the words <hi>Retorna Brevium,</hi> but in the Grant to <hi>Kingston,</hi> not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. Tot talia, &amp;c.</hi> does it, and 'tis as much as if all had been particularly recited, becauſe it refers to a thing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, if there were an Act of <hi>Reſumption,</hi> as in <hi>Pager and Darcy's Caſe;</hi> or if the thing were meerly Perſonal, as in the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of Walthams Caſe,</hi> the priviledge for his Dogs in the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> ſuch General Words will not revive and paſs the things, becauſe of the <hi>ratio privata</hi> which intervenes; but if there be nothing in the Caſe (which hinders) more than the generality of the words, 'tis clear the words do it; no Caſe can be fuller than <hi>Amerediths</hi> Caſe is in this point, <hi>9 Co. 29. B. 30.</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Colehar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi> above-mentioned. The <hi>Ret' Brev', &amp;c.</hi> came to the Crown by Act of Parliament. The King <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> grants to <hi>Francis Earl of Shrewsbury</hi> the Houſe, <hi>&amp; quod habeat tot talia, &amp;c.</hi> ſpecially reciting many Priviledges, Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not mentioning <hi>Returna Brevium,</hi> and concludes, <hi>&amp; alia, &amp;c.</hi> and it was adjudged that this Grant in theſe general words did revive <hi>Returna Brev'</hi> (for I have a Report of the Caſe) but only for the Cauſe above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Iudgment was given againſt the <hi>Earl</hi> as to the thing.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Verdict</hi> is ill found, the effectual <hi>Statute</hi> which ſhould aid this Caſe if there were need is <hi>1 Ed. 6. c. 8.</hi> which is not found; thereby it is Enacted, <hi>That all Letters Patents, &amp;c. made or to be made by the King of any Honours, &amp;c. Franchiſes, Liberties, &amp;c. ſhould be good, ſure, &amp;c. notwithſtanding any miſnaming, miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital or nonrecital of the Premiſſes, or the lack of the true naming
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:51792:205"/>
of the Natures, Kinds, Sorts and Qualities of them or any parcel thereof, and notwithſtanding divers and ſundry other ſuggeſtions and ſurmiſes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>3. The Patent of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. or at leaſt this Patent made to <hi>Kingston</hi> is void by reaſon of the Statute 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 12. (and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9.) whereby it is Ordained, <hi>That henceforth the Hundreds and Wapentakes ſhould not be given nor ſevered from the Counties.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This indeed is the grand Objection and was materially objected by my Brother <hi>Littleton,</hi> and the Caſe of <hi>Forteſcue</hi> againſt my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> has been truly cited to this purpoſe, which was in this Court, and is reported by himſelf. How ſhall we do now in this great difficulty? Truly this Objection had need be ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined into, for it runs to the avoiding of the Grants of <hi>100 Hundreds</hi> and more, which have been granted ſince <hi>2 E. 3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do conceive this Grant of <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> is not within the <hi>Statute,</hi> for though it be a New Grant of <hi>Ret' Brev'</hi> yet tis no New Grant of the <hi>Hundreds,</hi> neither is the Grant of <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> avoided hereby. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> This <hi>Statute</hi> extends only to thoſe <hi>Hundreds</hi> which were parcel of the <hi>Sheriffs Farm,</hi> and not to thoſe which were divided, becauſe as to the firſt only there was an inconvenience to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> in that he ſhould be charged with the <hi>Farm</hi> of the County (the <hi>Sheriffs Farm</hi>) and yet the profits, the <hi>Firma Ballivarum</hi> be taken from him. The words of the <hi>Statute</hi> are, <hi>That ſuch <hi>Hundreds (viz.)</hi> as were annexed to the <hi>Farms</hi> of the Counties ſhall not be given nor ſevered from the Counties,</hi> neither did theſe <hi>Hundreds</hi> come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sheriff</hi> by their coming to the Crown: The <hi>Sheriffs Farm</hi> was modelled and ſetled long before; and when theſe <hi>Hundreds</hi> came to <hi>H. 8.</hi> they were not part of the <hi>Sheriffs Farm,</hi> but he made <hi>Bayliffs</hi> of his own there, and they were within the Survey of the Court of <hi>Augmentations;</hi> ſo I ſay it refers only to thoſe <hi>Hundreds</hi> which made a part of the <hi>Sheriffs Farm.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>2.</hi> None of theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> extend to prohibit a Grant of an <hi>Hundred in Fee.

                     <p>My <hi>Lord Coke</hi> was very wary in what he ſaid about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for he knew, and the truth is, if this <hi>Statute</hi> ſhould make the Grants of <hi>Hundreds</hi> void, it would call in queſtion moſt of the <hi>Hundreds</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and particularly would ſhake his own Grants of <hi>Hundreds</hi> which he paſſed when <hi>Attorney General,</hi> and ſome of which his Poſterity enjoy at this day. <hi>8 H. 7. fol. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> and <hi>13 H. 7. fol. 19, 20.

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:51792:206"/>
Queſtions much argued, whereof the chief is, whether a <hi>Leet</hi> may be granted and paſs as part and parcel of a <hi>Hundred,</hi> and 'tis adjudged that it may; but it is the Opinion of all on all ſides, that the Grant of an <hi>Hundred</hi> is good, and ſo much is implied and concluded in the Iudgment; <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Amerediths Caſe, 9. Co. 29, 30.</hi> there Iudgment is given that the Grant of the <hi>Hundred</hi> is good.</p>
                     <p>I know that in <hi>11 H. 4.</hi> by Special Act of Parliament <hi>(vid. 1 H. 4. c. 11.)</hi> the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> had an allowance made to them for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Hundreds,</hi> which had been parcel of their <hi>Farms</hi> and were granted away, which could not have been if this <hi>Statute</hi> had made the Grants void.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I think there ought to be Judgment for the Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs I am glad with all my heart, that we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of this Caſe, for truly if I could have found any Thing to ſatisfie my Iudgment, I would have given Iudgment another way, both for the General Concern and for the ſake of the County of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> which I know will ſuffer much by this thing.</p>
                     <p>One ſhort Act of Parliament of three Lines, <hi>(viz.) That all Proceſs ſhould go with a <hi>non omittas propter aliquam libertatem</hi> (ſaving ſtill the Liberty) of a Mans Houſe, which indeed the Law in all ſuch Caſes ſaves now) would avoid a great delay of Juſtice, many Suits and Vexations, grievous Wrongs and oppreſſions, and would do more good to the Kingdom than all the Liberties of <hi>Retorna Brevium</hi> have been worth theſe 100 years; for as they are uſed now, they are nothing but a foundation of Brocage and Miſchief; they are a Feather in his Cap that has them, but they are a Thorn in the Foot of every one that has to do with them: For firſt the Party muſt go to the Underſheriff, and there he is handled; then through another Purgatory, to the Bayliff of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and there he is handled; and then to the Underbayliff, and there he is handled; and then to the Sheriff again.

                     <head>The Lord Chief Baron <hi>HALE</hi>'s Argument.</head>
                     <p>IN the Argument of this Caſe I ſhall ſuppoſe as clear and unqueſtionable, theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Patrick</hi> the Son, and <hi>William</hi> the Grandſon of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the elder Brother are not inheritable to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Earl,</hi> becauſe though they are both Denizens born, yet <hi>Nicholas</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thorough whom they muſt convey their Pedigree, was an Alien.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as <hi>Patrick</hi> and <hi>William</hi> cannot inherit, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they obſtruct the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>George,</hi> becauſe being deſcended from an Alien, the Law takes no notice of them as to this purpoſe; otherwiſe 'tis if the ſaid <hi>Nicholas</hi> had been a Denizen born and Attainted, becauſe in ſuch a caſe, though he could not take himſelf by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> he could obſtruct the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to the younger Brother, ſo the Land would <hi>Eſcheat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Caſe of <hi>George,</hi> the Son naturalized, and the Caſe of <hi>John</hi> his Son, as in reterence to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Earl,</hi> and the <hi>Diſcent</hi> from him will be all one; if <hi>George</hi> had ſurvived him, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> might have inherited, ſo will <hi>John</hi> his Son, who <hi>jure Repreſentationis,</hi> is the ſame with his Father, <hi>Et è Converſo.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Touching <hi>Diſcents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Touching the Capacities of Incapacities of an Alien.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Touching Naturalizations.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Diſcents</hi> I ſhall conſider,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Rule whereby they are to be Governed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The various kinds of <hi>Diſcents</hi> or hereditary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Rule of <hi>Diſcents,</hi> we muſt not govern our ſelves therein by the General Notions of <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Proximity</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but by the Principal <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> where the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> ariſeth; for the various <hi>Countries</hi> have variouſly diſpoſed the manner of <hi>Diſcents,</hi> even in the ſame <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For Inſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Father is certainly as near of Kin to the Son as the Son is to the Father, and is nearer in <hi>Proximity</hi> than a Brother, and therefore ſhall be preferred as next of Kin in an Adminiſtration, <hi>3 Rep. Ratcliffs Caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet touching the Succeſſion of the Father to the purchaſe of his Son, the <hi>Laws</hi> of ſeveral Countries variouſly provide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> According to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for want of Iſſue of the Son, the Father ſucceeds, excluding the Brother, and that hath been the Vſe and Conſtruction of the Jewiſh Doctors, upon <hi>Number 27. Selden de Succeſſionibus, Hebr. Cap. 12.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Mother was wholly excluded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> According to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Proviſion for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Father is left doubtful, <hi>Petit Leges 1, 6. fol. 6.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Civil Law,</hi> by the Conſtruction of the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Twelve Tables,</hi> the Father ſucceeds in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the Son for want of Iſſue of the Son under the Title of <hi>Proximus Agnatus,</hi> and accordingly was their Vſage, tho' my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> ſuppoſed the contrary, <hi>Co. Lit. 5.</hi> But to ſettle all, the Inſtitutes of <hi>Juſtinian, Lib. 3. Tit. 3.</hi> in an Authentick Collection, <hi>8. Tit. de Haered' ab inteſtato venientibus,</hi> the Son dying without Iſſue, his Brothers and Siſters, Father and Mother do ſucceed him in a kind of Coparcenary as well to Lands as Goods.</p>
                     <p>According to the Cuſtoms of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which in ſome things have a Cognition with the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Son dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, his Brothers are preferred before the Father, but the Father is preferred before the Vncles, <hi>Terrien. lib. 6. c. 6. la Cuſtomier de Normandie, cap. Deſcheants.</hi>

                        <hi>5.</hi> According to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the Son dying without Iſſue, or Brother or Siſter, the Father cannot ſucceed, but it deſcends to the Vncle. And it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law, <hi>An Inheritance cannot Lineally aſcend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſequently, the Queſtion being in this Caſe touching a <hi>Diſcent</hi> of <hi>Lands</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> it muſt be Ruled and Diſputed according to the Grounds and Reaſons of the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Touching the Second, the Diviſion of <hi>Diſcents</hi> are of two kinds:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Lineal,</hi> as from the Father or Grandfather, to the Son or Grandſon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Collateral</hi> or <hi>Tranſverſal,</hi> as from Brother to Brother, Vncle to Nephew, or <hi>è converſo.</hi> And both theſe are again of two ſorts:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Immediate, as in <hi>Lineals</hi> from Father to Son.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mediate, as in <hi>Lineals</hi> from Grandfather to Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Father dying in the Life of the Grandfather, when the Father is the <hi>medium differens</hi> of the Diſcent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In <hi>Collaterals,</hi> from the Vncle to the Nephew, or from the Nephew to the Vncle, where the Father is likewiſe the <hi>medium differens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I call this a <hi>Mediate Diſcent,</hi> tho' as to many purpoſes it be <hi>Immediate;</hi> for the Father dying in the Life of the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the Son ſucceeds in point of Diſcent of the Laws imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Grandfather; and in a Writ of <hi>Entry</hi> ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the <hi>Per</hi> to the Grandfather, and not in the <hi>Per</hi> and <hi>Cui.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I call it a <hi>Mediate Diſcent,</hi> becauſe the Father is the <hi>medium</hi> through or by whom the Son derives his <hi>Title</hi> to the Grandfather.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if any man thinks the term of <hi>Mediate Diſcent</hi> not properly uſed, he may if he pleaſe uſe the words of <hi>Mediate</hi> or <hi>Immediate Anceſtors. Words</hi> are impoſed to ſignifie <hi>Things,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Terms</hi> being explained what I mean by them, I ſhall retain the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Mediate</hi> or <hi>Immediate Diſcents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſtinction of <hi>Diſcents</hi> or <hi>Relations</hi> between <hi>Anceſtor</hi> and <hi>Heir,</hi> and <hi>Hereditary Succeſſion,</hi> will be of uſe throughout this whole Debate.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Immediate Diſcents</hi> there can be no Impediment, but what ariſes in the parties themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtance,</p>
                     <p>The Father ſeiſed of Lands, the Impediment that hinders the <hi>Diſcent</hi> muſt be either in the Father or the Son; as if the Father or the Son be Attaint, or an Alien.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="416" facs="tcp:51792:208"/>In <hi>Immediate Diſcents,</hi> a Diſability of being an Alien or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint in him that I call a <hi>medius Anceſtor,</hi> will diſable a perſon to take by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> tho' he himſelf hath no ſuch Diſability.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtance,</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Lineal Diſcents:</hi> If the Father be Attaint or an Alien, and hath Iſſue a <hi>Denizen</hi> born, and dies in the life of the Grandfather, the Grandfather dies ſeiſed; the Son ſhall not take, but the Land ſhall <hi>Eſcheat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Collateral Diſcents:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> Brothers, <hi>A.</hi> is an Alien or Attainted, and hath Iſſue <hi>C.</hi> a <hi>Denizen</hi> born. <hi>B.</hi> purchaſeth Lands and dies without Iſſue, <hi>C.</hi> ſhall not inherit; for <hi>A.</hi> (which was the <hi>Medius Anceſtor,</hi> or <hi>medium differens</hi> of this <hi>Diſcent</hi>) was incapable, <hi>Dyer 274. Gray's Caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is apparent in this very Caſe; for by this means <hi>Patrick,</hi> tho' a <hi>Denizen,</hi> and the Son of an Elder Brother, is diſabled to inherit the Earl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> Brothers, <hi>A.</hi> is an Alien or perſon Attainted, and hath Iſſue <hi>C.</hi> and dies, and <hi>C.</hi> purchaſeth Lands and dies without Iſſue. <hi>B.</hi> his Vncle ſhall not inherit for the Reaſon before-going; for <hi>A.</hi> is a <hi>Medius,</hi> which was diſabled. This is <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's Caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if in our Caſe <hi>Patrick</hi> the Son of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> altho' a <hi>Denizen</hi> born, had purchaſed Lands and died without Iſſue, <hi>John</hi> his Vncle ſhould not have Inherited him by reaſon of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of <hi>Nicholas;</hi> and yet <hi>Nicholas</hi> himſelf, had he not been an Alien, could not immediately have Inherited to his Son; but yet he is a Block in the way to <hi>John.</hi> See the Reaſon <hi>17 E. 4. cap. 1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this muſt be intended of ſuch as are abſolute Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>Attainder</hi> or <hi>Alien,</hi> not <hi>Temporary ſuſpenſions:</hi> As in the Lord <hi>Delaware's Caſe</hi> in <hi>10 Co.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in any <hi>Diſcents</hi> the Impediment of an Anceſtor that is <hi>Medius Anceſtor,</hi> between the perſons from whom and to whom, will not impede the <hi>Diſcent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grandfather and Grandmother both Aliens, or Attaint of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> have Iſſue the Father a <hi>Denizen,</hi> who hath Iſſue the Son a <hi>Denizen;</hi> the Son ſhall be Heir to the Father notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Diſability of the Grandfather: For they are not <hi>Medii anteceſſores</hi> between the Father and the Son, but <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount;</hi> and yet all the <hi>Blood</hi> the Father hath he derived from his diſabled Parents.</p>
                     <p>And this <hi>Obſervation</hi> ſtates in effect the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>For if the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between Brothers be an <hi>Immediate diſcent,</hi> and that the Father be not <hi>Medius anteceſſor</hi> between them, then the Diſability in <hi>Robert</hi> will not impede the <hi>Diſcent</hi> of <hi>George</hi>
                        <pb n="417" facs="tcp:51792:208"/>
his Brother, or to <hi>John</hi> his Brother's Son. But if it be a <hi>Mediate diſcent,</hi> and the Father be a <hi>Medius anteceſſor</hi> between them, then the Diſability in <hi>Robert</hi> the Father may impeach the <hi>Diſcent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Term</hi> to be explained, is that diſabling <hi>Term</hi> of an <hi>Alien,</hi> and to conſider what Diſability ariſeth from it. The Law that is the Rule of <hi>Diſcents</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> is alſo the meaſure of this <hi>Nonability,</hi> and is the only Rule that muſt determine how far it extends.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I conſider, what <hi>Diſability</hi> the Law doth induce in caſe of an <hi>Alien.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It doth not hinder, but that an <hi>Alien</hi> is of the ſame Degree and Relation of <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> as in the like caſes of a <hi>Denizen</hi> born. The Son, Father and Brother tho' <hi>Aliens,</hi> are yet Son, Father and Brother as <hi>Natural born Subjects,</hi> and ſo taken notice of in our Law.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Cro. Car. Carroon's Caſe,</hi> he ſhall be preferred in <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as next of Kin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> What the Law doth do as to <hi>Diſabilities</hi> of an <hi>Alien:</hi> And this is of two kinds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Diſability</hi> that is Perſonal or Original to the <hi>Alien</hi> himſelf, in reference to Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>Tho' he may take by Purchaſe by his own <hi>Contract</hi> that which he cannot retain againſt the <hi>King,</hi> yet the Law will not enable him by Act of his own, to transfer by <hi>Hereditary diſcent,</hi> the <hi>Alien</hi> dying, having ſince a <hi>Denizen</hi> born, the <hi>Land</hi> will not deſcend.</p>
                     <p>Or to take by an Act in Law; for the Law, <hi>quae nihil fruſtra,</hi> will not give an <hi>Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Freehold</hi> by Act in Law, for he cannot keep it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the <hi>Law</hi> will not give him,
<list>
                           <item>1. Diſcent.</item>
                           <item>2. Courteſy.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>And in reſpect of this Incapacity he doth reſemble a perſon <hi>Attaint;</hi> yet with this difference, the <hi>Law</hi> looks upon a perſon <hi>Attaint</hi> as one that it takes notice of: And therefore the eldeſt Son <hi>Attaint,</hi> over-living his Father, tho' he ſhall not take by <hi>Diſcent</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Diſability,</hi> yet he ſhall hinder the <hi>Diſcent</hi> of the younger Son.</p>
                     <p>But if the Eldeſt Son be an <hi>Alien,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> takes no notice of him; and therefore as he ſhall not take by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> ſo he ſhall not impede the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to his younger Brother, <hi>32 E. 3. Couſenage 5.</hi> A conſequential <hi>Conſecutive Diſability</hi> that reflects to an <hi>Alien</hi> from one that muſt derive by or through him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' he perchance be a Natural born Subject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:51792:209"/>As in our Caſe, tho' <hi>Patrick</hi> the Son of <hi>Nicholas</hi> be a Natural born Subject, yet becauſe <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Father was an <hi>Alien,</hi> there is a <hi>Conſecutive Impediment</hi> derived upon <hi>Patrick,</hi> whereby he is Conſequentially diſabled to Inherit <hi>John</hi> his Vncle; and this <hi>Conſecutive Diſability</hi> is parallel to that which we call <hi>Corruption of Blood,</hi> which is a Conſequent of <hi>Attainder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Father be <hi>Attainted,</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Grandfather is not Corrupted, no nor the <hi>Blood</hi> of his Son, tho' he could not inherit him, but only the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Father: But that <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> in the Father draws a <hi>Conſequential Impediment</hi> upon the Son to inherit the Grandfather; becauſe the Fathers <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> obſtructs the tranſmiſſion of the <hi>Hereditary diſcent</hi> between the Grandfather and the Son.</p>
                     <p>And here we muſt take notice of a great diverſity between a <hi>Diſability</hi> in the <hi>Blood</hi> and a <hi>Bar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cro. Car. 16. Edwards and Rogers's Caſe. William Rogers</hi> was ſeiſed of a <hi>Reverſion</hi> in <hi>Fee, Andrew</hi> his Vncle levies a <hi>Fine</hi> with <hi>Proclamations</hi> and dies, having Iſſue <hi>John,</hi> who dies leaving Iſſue <hi>William;</hi> then <hi>William Rogers</hi> dies without Iſſue. Ruled, that <hi>William</hi> the Grandſon of <hi>Andrew</hi> ſhall inherit, notwithſtanding the <hi>Fine</hi> of his Grandfather; and the Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>William Rogers</hi> dying after <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Eſtate never paſſed through <hi>Andrew,</hi> and conſequently <hi>William</hi> the Grandſon claiming from <hi>William,</hi> is in effect a Stranger to the <hi>Fine</hi> of <hi>Andrew,</hi> and may aver that <hi>Partes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in that Caſe had <hi>Andrew</hi> been an <hi>Alien,</hi> or <hi>Attaint,</hi> then had <hi>William</hi> his Grandſon been diſabled to have inherited <hi>William</hi> by the <hi>Conſecutive Diſability.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in the Caſe at Bar, there is firſt no doubt but that <hi>John</hi> the Earl and <hi>George</hi> were Brothers, tho' they continued <hi>Aliens;</hi> neither is there any queſtion that they could not have inherited one the other had they continued <hi>Aliens;</hi> neither is there any queſtion whether that <hi>Perſonal Diſability</hi> be removed by the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Queſtion is, Whether any <hi>Conſequential</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutive Diſabilities</hi> do reſult upon them from their Father <hi>Roberts</hi> being an <hi>Alien,</hi> which may diſable the one Brother to Inherit, tho' there <hi>Perſonal diſability</hi> be removed? I come now to the Explication of the <hi>Third Term, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
                        </hi> the <hi>Reſtoring</hi> or <hi>Enabling Term, Naturalization.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Means of removing <hi>Diſabilities</hi> of this kind are two:</p>
                     <p>A temporary, partial and imperfect amotion thereof, <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of <hi>Denization,</hi> which tho' it puts the Perſon <hi>Denized</hi> as to ſome purpoſes in the Condition of a Subject, and enables a <hi>Tranſmiſſion Hereditary</hi> to his Children born after the <hi>Denization;</hi> yet it doth not wholly remove the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> or <hi>Nonability,</hi> as to the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:51792:209"/>
point of <hi>Diſcents</hi> or <hi>Hereditary Tranſmiſſion,</hi> and reſembles a <hi>Pardon</hi> in caſe of an <hi>Attainder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore in <hi>Lineal Diſcents,</hi> if there be Grandfather a Natural born Subject, Father Alien, Son Natural; the Father is made <hi>Denizen,</hi> he ſhall not inherit the Grandfather; and if the Father dies in the life of the Grandfather, the Grandchild, tho' born after the <hi>Denization,</hi> doth not remove either the <hi>Perſonal,</hi> or the <hi>Conſequential Impediment</hi> or <hi>Incapacity</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Collateral Diſcents</hi> the Father a Natural born Subject hath <hi>Iſſue</hi> two Sons <hi>Aliens,</hi> who are both made <hi>Denizens,</hi> and one dies without Iſſue, the other ſhall not inherit him. This was agreed in <hi>Godfrey and Dixon's Caſe,</hi> hereafter cited.</p>
                     <p>The Second is more deep, <hi>
                           <hi>(viz.)</hi> Naturalization.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to the Laws of <hi>Normandy</hi> they may <hi>Naturalize,</hi> but ſuch <hi>Naturalization</hi> ſhall not diveſt a <hi>Diſcent</hi> already veſted. <hi>Terrien lib. 2. cap. 12.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But according to our Law it can only be by Parliament, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And this cures the Defect, and makes them as if they had been Born in <hi>England;</hi> and no man ſhall be received againſt an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to ſay the contrary; and therefore if the Father an <hi>Alien</hi> hath Iſſue a Son born here, and then the Father is <hi>Naturalized,</hi> the Son ſhall inherit.</p>
                     <p>If the Father a <hi>Natural Subject</hi> hath Iſſue a Son an <hi>Alien,</hi> who is <hi>Naturalized;</hi> the Father dies, the Son ſhall inherit, <hi>Co. Lit. 129.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the retroſpect of a <hi>Naturalization,</hi> and whether the Son being an Alien <hi>Naturalized</hi> after the death of the Father, ſhall direct the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to the youngeſt, depends upon the words of the <hi>Naturalization,</hi> which being by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> may by a ſtrange retroſpect direct it.</p>
                     <p>But as the <hi>Naturalization</hi> in the Caſe in queſtion is Penned it would not do it, the <hi>Naturalization</hi> hath only reſpect to what ſhall be hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The Clauſe of taking by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> after the Commencement of the <hi>Seſſion</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> is ſufficient to check that Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                     <p>And this brings me to the Conſideration of the <hi>Naturalization</hi> in the Caſe in queſtion, and the Effect thereof, which I ſhall not Argue as a Point; becauſe I take the Point of the Caſe to be ſingle: But I ſhall deliver my Opinion of it by way of <hi>Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>(Read the Naturalization.)</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In this <hi>Naturalization</hi> I ſhall ſet down, what Effect it hath. And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Effect it hath not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> What Effect it hath: It doth doubtleſs remove that <hi>Inability</hi> and <hi>Incapacity</hi> that is in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> in reſpect of themſelves, being <hi>Aliens,</hi> and ſo put them in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as if they had been Born in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if there be a <hi>Conſequential Impediment</hi> or <hi>Incapacity</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived upon them by <hi>Robert,</hi> their <hi>Fathers</hi> being an Alien, which might hinder their <hi>Succeſſions</hi> one to another, which at the preſent I ſuppoſe, or admit: I ſay, if there be any ſuch <hi>Conſequential Impediment,</hi> this I take is not removed by this <hi>Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My <hi>Reaſons</hi> are briefly theſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Naturalization</hi> hath a proper <hi>Subject</hi> upon which it may work, and with which it is ſatisfied, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Perſonal defects</hi> of the Parties <hi>Naturalized;</hi> becauſe this Defect ariſing from the <hi>Incapacity</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> is not in any meaſure taken notice of by the <hi>Act,</hi> nor ſo much as mentioned that the <hi>Father</hi> was an <hi>Alien.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the whole ſcope of the <hi>Act,</hi> and every Clauſe of it, and thoſe <hi>Relative Terms (As if Born in England,)</hi> is only to ſupply the <hi>Perſonal defect</hi> of the Parties <hi>Naturalized,</hi> ariſing from their Birth out of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore ſhall never be carried to a <hi>Collateral</hi> purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Objection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho' this Remedy will not Cure a Diſeaſe of another nature, as <hi>Illegitimation, Half-Blood, &amp;c.</hi> yet it Cures all the defects of <hi>Foreign Births,</hi> whether in the <hi>Parties</hi> themſelves, or reſulting from the <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> And the Act might have been ſo Penned as it might have done it; but it is not.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plaiſter</hi> is applied only to defects in the ariſing from their own <hi>Birth;</hi> not defects ariſing from the <hi>Father,</hi> or that <hi>Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſability</hi> ariſing thereby.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Second Objection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we find in <hi>Curteen's Caſe, Placita Coronae 241.</hi> that where the <hi>Father</hi> was Attainted, the Reſtitution in <hi>Blood</hi> granted by the Act to the <hi>Son,</hi> cures that <hi>diſability</hi> that reſults from the <hi>Fathers</hi> Attainder; and this not only to the <hi>Son,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Collateral Heirs</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I have before obſerved, the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> by Attainder, is only of the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> for the <hi>Son's Blood</hi> was not at all <hi>Corrupted.</hi> By this Act of <hi>Reſtitution,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Notice is taken of the <hi>Father</hi>'s Attainder.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> It doth Intentionally provide againſt it, and it was the only buſineſs of that <hi>Act</hi> to remove it.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:51792:210"/>
                        <hi>3.</hi> Had it not removed that <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> it had been uſeleſs; for there had been nothing elſe for it to provide againſt, and ſo the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> had been idle had it not had that Effect. But in our Caſe the <hi>Naturalization,</hi> as it takes no notice of the defect in the <hi>Father,</hi> nor provides againſt it; ſo it hath another buſineſs to ſatisfie, it doth remedy the <hi>Foreign Birth</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let us examine the ſeveral <hi>Clauſes</hi> in this Act of <hi>Naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi> we ſhall find the whole ſcope of it was no other, than to put them in the ſame and no better Condition, than as if they were Born in <hi>England.</hi> This is the <hi>Governing Clauſe,</hi> both in the firſt and laſt <hi>Sentence,</hi> and hath an influence upon all the <hi>Clauſes</hi> that intervene.</p>
                     <p>It hath been endeavoured to break the <hi>Context,</hi> and to make the <hi>Clauſe (As if Born in <hi>England</hi>
                        </hi>) to be cumulative and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant.</p>
                     <p>But this were by a Nicety to alter the ſcope and intent of the Act.</p>
                     <p>If it were omitted, yet the firſt <hi>Clauſe</hi> making him but a <hi>Natural Born Subject</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, ſurely makes him no more, and meddles not with the <hi>diſability</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> or the <hi>Conſequence</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>There hath been ſome ſtreſs laid upon the <hi>Clauſe,</hi> which enables him to make his reſort and Pedigree to Anceſtors <hi>Lineal</hi> or <hi>Collateral,</hi> as if that ſhould Entitle <hi>George</hi> at leaſt to ſome more advantage by <hi>Naturalization,</hi> than if he had been Born here.</p>
                     <p>But to this I ſay,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That is a <hi>General Clauſe,</hi> and cannot make a <hi>Legal Anceſtor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Vpon the ſame Reaſon it may make <hi>John</hi> or <hi>George</hi> inheritable to <hi>Patrick,</hi> and not adjudge the <hi>diſability</hi> of <hi>Nicholas</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> which no man pretends.</p>
                     <p>It makes him as much inheritable to <hi>Anceſtors Lineal,</hi> as well as <hi>Collateral;</hi> and yet it makes no <hi>Anceſtors Lineal.</hi> The Words are <hi>General,</hi> and create no new <hi>Anceſtor,</hi> that the Law doth not enable.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that in the Argument of <hi>Godfrey and Dixon's Caſe,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Mountague</hi> laid ſome ſtreſs upon theſe <hi>Ancillary Clauſes;</hi> but the reſt rather reſted upon the very <hi>Matter,</hi> that the party <hi>Naturalized</hi> was become thereby a <hi>Natural born Subject.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>Naturalization,</hi> which doth not Cure any diſability of <hi>Tranſmiſſion Hereditary</hi> between the <hi>Brothers,</hi> reſulting from the diſability of the <hi>Father,</hi> if any ſuch be.</p>

                        <pb n="422" facs="tcp:51792:211"/>But it doth cure the Perſonal diſability in <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and makes them to all intents as <hi>Natural Subjects</hi> as if they had been born in <hi>England.</hi> So that now the Caſe made is no more than this:</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Alien</hi> hath Iſſue two Sons born in <hi>England,</hi> and one purchaſeth <hi>Lands</hi> and dies without Iſſue, whether the other ſhall inherit?</p>
                     <p>For, as I have before obſerved, the Caſe of <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>George</hi> is all one with the Caſe of <hi>George</hi> himſelf, whom he repreſents; as to the Point of the Diſcent from <hi>John</hi> the Earl.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to the Argument of the Queſtion, the <hi>Verdict</hi> had need be delivered from a Queſtion, which poſſibly would make an end of the Diſpute.</p>
                     <p>It hath been ſaid, that if the Wife of <hi>Robert</hi> were an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, there would be no queſtion but the <hi>Land</hi> might diſcend between the Brothers <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> tho' <hi>Robert</hi> the Father were an Alien; and that it ſhall be ſo intended, becauſe nothing appears to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>To this I ſay,</p>
                     <p>It is true, that if the Mother were an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, the <hi>Diſcent</hi> from <hi>John</hi> to <hi>George</hi> his Son would be unqueſtionable: For notwithſtanding the Incapacity of <hi>Robert</hi> the Father, by being an Alien, they might inherit their Mother, and conſequently they might inherit one the other.</p>
                     <p>It hath been endeavoured to be Anſwered, that it is not poſſible the Mother could be an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, becauſe the <hi>Sons</hi> are found to be Aliens.</p>
                     <p>But that will not be ſo, altho' an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man marry an Alien beyond the Seas, and having there Iſſue, the <hi>Iſſue</hi> will be <hi>Denizens,</hi> as hath been often Reſolved: Yet it is without queſtion, that if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman go beyond the Seas and marry an Alien, and have Iſſue born beyond the Seas, the <hi>Iſſue</hi> are Aliens; for the Wife was <hi>ſub poteſtate viri,</hi> and yet the Iſſue born in <hi>England</hi> ſhould inherit tho' the Husband be an Alien.</p>
                     <p>But the true Anſwer is, That in this Caſe <hi>Robert</hi> the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being an Alien, born out of the Allegiance of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and marrying, and having all his Iſſues born there, She ſhall not be preſumed an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, but ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a Native in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where her Husband lived and had Iſſue, unleſs the contrary had been expreſly found.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the Point in queſtion, it is true that Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in his <hi>Littl. fo. 8.</hi> is of another Opinion: He ſays, <hi>That if an Alien have two Sons born in <hi>England,</hi> and one dye without Iſſue, the other ſhall not inherit him.</hi> But I take the <hi>Law</hi> to be the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="423" facs="tcp:51792:211"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will ſhew what Reaſons do not move me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Reaſons do convince and ſatisfie me.</p>
                     <p>It doth not move me thus to conclude, becauſe there is no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus Parriae,</hi> or <hi>Nationis</hi> or <hi>Ligeantiae</hi> of either of the Brothers; for tho' there be no perſonal defect in either of the Extreams, yet it may be poſſible that a conſequential Impediment ariſing from another Anceſtor, may hinder the <hi>Diſcent;</hi> and this is apparent in the Caſe in queſtion, for <hi>Patrick</hi> the Son of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Elder, Brother of <hi>John</hi> the Earl, hath no <hi>Defectus Ligeantiae,</hi> for he was <hi>naturalized,</hi> yet the Land ſhall not <hi>Diſcend</hi> from <hi>John</hi> the Earl to <hi>Patrick</hi> by reaſon of the defect of <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Father, neither doth it move me that <hi>George</hi> or <hi>John</hi> his Son do not claim the Land from <hi>Robert</hi> the Father, but from <hi>John</hi> the Earl, for if the Grandfather be ſeized, the Father is an <hi>Alien.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Son of Denizen born, the Father dies in the Life of the Grandfather, the Son ſhall not inherit by reaſon of the defect of the Father, tho' he claim nothing from him, but from the Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But the Reaſons that ſatisfie me are theſe three in order as they are propounded.</p>
                     <p>My firſt Reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Diſcent</hi> from a Brother to a Brother, tho' it be a <hi>Collateral Diſcent,</hi> yet it is an <hi>Immediate Diſcent,</hi> and conſequently upon what hath been premiſed at firſt, unleſs we can find a diſability or impediment in them, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in another Anceſtor will hinder the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between them.</p>
                     <p>Now to prove this <hi>Diſcent</hi> immediate, I ſhall uſe theſe three enſuing Inſtances or Evidences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In point of Pleading, one Brother ſhall derive himſelf as Heir to another, without mentioning another Anceſtor; this hath been at large inſiſted on by others, and therefore I ſhall paſs it over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> According to the computation of Degrees, according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> Brother and Brother make one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and the Brother is diſtant from his Brother and Siſter in the firſt degree of Conſanguinity.</p>
                     <p>According to the Civil Law, the Brother is in the ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre from the Brother, for they make one Degree from the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Father, and from the Father a ſecond Degree to the other Brother; but yet they ſay in Collaterals, <hi>Nullus eſt proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mior Fratre, ideoque in Collateralibus nullus eſt primus Gradus, ſed ſecundus Gradus obtinet vocem primi, <hi>Inſt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit. B. de Gradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Conſaguinitatis.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to the Cannon Law, <hi>Frater &amp; Frater, Soror &amp; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſunt in primo Gradu, <hi>Decret' gratian Laus</hi> 35. <hi>queſt.</hi> 5. <hi>ad ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi>
                        </hi> and therefore their Laws prohibiting Marriage in the fourth
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:51792:212"/>
Degree, take Brother and Siſter to be the firſt Degree of the fourth.</p>
                     <p>The Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in computation of the Degrees of Conſanguinity, agree with the Common Law, and reckon the Brother and Brother to be the firſt Degree, and this is apparent by <hi>Littl' ſect. 20.</hi> and the Objection of <hi>Lord Coke</hi> thereupon, and the Book of <hi>31 E. 3. Hollands Caſe cited by Littleton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And with this likewiſe agrees the Laws and Cuſtome of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> which tho' in ſome things they differ from the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as is before obſerved, yet in this particular and divers other touching <hi>Diſcents,</hi> they agree with it, <hi>Vid. Glov. Com. ſuper Cuſtomeir de Normandy, in Cap. de Eſcheat, Et doir un' Scavoir que tonque le Cuſtome de paijs de Normandy pur compter les Degrees en Line Collateral ſolonque les Cannoiſts deux freres ont le primier Degree &amp; eont que en Degree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My third Evidence that the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between Brothers is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, this <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between Brothers differs from all others <hi>Collateral Diſcents</hi> whatſoever, for in other <hi>Diſcents Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral</hi> the half Blood doth inherit, but in a <hi>Diſcent</hi> between Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the half Blood doth impede the <hi>Diſcent,</hi> which argues that the <hi>Diſcent</hi> is immediate.</p>
                     <p>The Vncle of the part of the Father hath no more of the Blood of the Mother, than the Brother of the Second <hi>Venter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Brother by the ſecond <hi>Venter</hi> hath the immediate Blood of the Father, which the Vncle <hi>(viz)</hi> the Fathers Brother hath not, but only as they meet in the Grandfather.</p>
                     <p>The Brother of the half Blood is nearer of Blood than the Vncle, and therefore ſhall be preferred in the Adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>And ſo it hath been reſolved in <hi>5 E. 6.</hi> in <hi>Browns Caſe,</hi> and tho' the Book of <hi>5 E. 6. B. Adminiſtration 47.</hi> miſtakes the Law in preferring the Brother of the half Blood before the Mother, yet it had been right in the caſe of a Competition between him and the Vncle.</p>
                     <p>And yet the Vncle is preferred in the <hi>Diſcent</hi> before the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the half Blood, and the reaſon is, becauſe that is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Diſcent, mediante Patre;</hi> but the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to the Brother muſt be immediate if at all, and therefore the half Blood impedes it.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is apparent, that if in the Line between Brother and Brother the Law took notice of the Father as the <hi>Medium</hi> thereof, the Brother by the ſecond <hi>Venter</hi> ſhould rather ſucceed the other Brother, becauſe he is Heir to his Father; therefore in a <hi>Diſcent</hi> between Brothers the Law reſpects only the mediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Brothers as Brothers, and not in reſpect of their Father, tho' it is true the Boſom or Foundation of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity is in the Father and Mother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="425" facs="tcp:51792:212"/>My ſecond principal Reaſon is to prove, that the diſability of the Father doth not at all hinder the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers immediate is this,</p>
                     <p>If the Father in caſe of a <hi>Diſcent</hi> between Brothers, were ſuch an Anceſtor as the Law looks upon as the <hi>Medium</hi> that derives the one <hi>Diſcent</hi> from the other, then the Attainder of the Father would hinder the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between the Brothers.</p>
                     <p>But the Attainder of the Father doth not hinder the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between the Brothers.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Father is not ſuch a <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Nexus</hi> as is look'd upon by Law as the means deriving ſuch <hi>Diſcent</hi> between the two Brothers.</p>
                     <p>Both the former Propoſitions, and indeed the Illuſtration and Enforcement of the whole reaſon, will be evidenced by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of three Caſes, the two former of the Caſes evincing the truth of the firſt Propoſition, and the later proving the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is <hi>Gravers's Caſe 10 Eliz. Dyer 274.</hi> The younger Brother hath Iſſue and is attaint of Treaſon and dies, the elder Brother having a Title to a Petition of Right, dies without Iſſue, without a Reſtitution, the other Brothers Son hath loſt that Title; for though that Title were in an Anceſtor, that was not attainted, yet his Father that is the <hi>Medium</hi> whereby he muſt convey that Title, was Attainted, and ſo the <hi>Diſcent</hi> is obſtructed.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, the Caſe of <hi>Courtney, in Cro. Car. 241. Henry Courtney</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Edward,</hi> and is attaint of Treaſon and dies, <hi>Edward</hi> purchaſeth Lands, and dies without Iſſue, the Siſters and Siſters Children of <hi>Henry</hi> are diſabled to inherit <hi>Edward,</hi> yet neither <hi>Edward</hi> nor his Aunts were attainted, nor their Blood corrupted, as is before manifeſted, but only <hi>Henry;</hi> tho' the Land could not diſcend immediately from <hi>Edward,</hi> yet becauſe he who nevertheleſs was the <hi>Medium</hi> whereby the Aunts muſt derive their Pedigree and Conſanguinity to <hi>Edward</hi> was attainted, the <hi>Diſcent</hi> was obſtructed till a reſtitution in Blood.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe that the Grandfather of <hi>Edward</hi> was attainted, and not <hi>Henry,</hi> this could not have hindred the <hi>Diſcent</hi> from <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to his Aunts, becauſe the Attainder had been paramount, that Conſanguinity which was between <hi>Henry</hi> and his Siſters, as Brothers and Siſters, and that is proved by the third Caſe.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>40 &amp; 41 Eliz.</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer, Hobbies Caſe, William Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and is attainted of Treaſon and dies, <hi>Philip</hi> purchaſeth Lands, and dies without Iſſue; Ruled that notwithſtanding the Attainder, <hi>Mary</hi> ſhall inherit, becauſe the <hi>Diſcent</hi> between <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> was immediate, and the Law regards not the diſability of the Father, and in that Caſe all the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:51792:213"/>
Reaſons that have been objected againſt the <hi>Diſcent</hi> in the Caſe at Bar, were objected.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected that in that Caſe the Mother was not attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which might preſerve the Legal Blood between <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, That that would not ſerve, admitting the diſability of the Parents were not at all conſiderable; for if it diſable the Blood of the Father which is derived to the Son, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly deſtroy the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to <hi>Mary</hi> the Siſter, for ſhe could not inherit her Brother in the capacity of Heir to the part of the Mother, if by the Attainder ſhe had been diſabled to take as Heir by the Fathers Blood, <hi>49 E. 3. 12.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Heir on the part of the Father be attainted, the Land ſhall eſcheat, and ſhall never diſcend to the Heir of the Mother, becauſe notwithſtanding the Attainder, the Law looks upon it as in <hi>eſſe;</hi> but otherwiſe it is in caſe of an <hi>Alien,</hi> as hath been before ſhewn; for if the Son purchaſe Land and have no Kindred on the part of his Father, but an <hi>Alien,</hi> it ſhall diſcend to the Heir of the part of the Mother.</p>
                     <p>And altho' the Blood both of the Father and the Mother were in <hi>Mary,</hi> yet if ſhe were diſabled in the Blood of her Father by his Attainder, ſhe could never intitle her ſelf by the Blood of her Mother.</p>
                     <p>I have done with this Reaſon, there remain two Principal Objections to be anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>1. The Father in the Caſe at Bar, is the Fountain from whence the Blood of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George</hi> is derived, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity ariſeth not from one to another, but from their Father, which is the common <hi>vinculum</hi> to them both, and therefore this diſability in the Parents deſtroys the Civil Relation of Hereditary Blood between the two Brothers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Anſwer Firſt,</hi> The very ſame Objection might be, and indeed was made in <hi>Hobbies Caſe,</hi> but prevailed not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> But further, no man will ſay but that the Blood of the Father and Mother are neceſſary to derive Conſanguinity in the Son, for the Blood of the Father without the Mother is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be derived to the Children; and yet no man will deny, that if the one or the other were <hi>Denizen</hi> born, their Children ſhould inherit one the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But the truth is, the Father and the Mother are the Blood Natural to both the Sons, but it is the Law into which by their Birth or Naturalization they are tranſlated, that is the Fountain of the Civil or Hereditary Blood; the Parents are the common <hi>Vinculum,</hi> the Fonntain of their Blood, that <hi>aliquod tertium in quo conveniunt in regno naturali,</hi> but it is the Law of the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:51792:213"/>
Land into which by their birth, or naturalization they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, the <hi>Commune Vinculum,</hi> that <hi>aliquod tertium in quo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt in Regno Civili.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>2. But all their blood that they have is derived from their Parents, and they can take no other blood but what they have from them; and if that blood which the Parents tranſmit be ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and void of Hereditary Quality, no hereditary blood can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene between them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> It is true that their natural blood is derived from their Parents, and as it is that that makes them Brothers Sons, ſo it is that that makes them their blood; but yet the civil qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of their blood which makes them inheritable one to the other is from another Fountain <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Law of the Land; and this Law finding them Legitimate <hi>&amp; untrinque conjunctos ſanguine parentali naturali,</hi> and ſo natural Brothers, and finding them tranſplanted into the civil rights of this Kingdom by their birth here or Naturalization, which is all one, doth ſuperinduce and cloſe the natural Conſanguinity, with a civil hereditary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whereby they may inherit one the other.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtance,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Grandfather and <hi>B.</hi> his Wife, both <hi>Aliens,</hi> have Iſſue <hi>C.</hi> a Son born here, who hath Iſſue <hi>D.</hi> a Son alſo born here.</p>
                     <p>No body can deny that <hi>C.</hi> hath all his natural blood from <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and no where elſe; nor is that blood that he hath ſo from them, an inheritable blood, yet is it unqueſtionable that <hi>D.</hi> ſhall inherit <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> hath no natural blood but what he hath from <hi>C.</hi> nor <hi>C.</hi> no natural blood but what he hath from <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> But true it is, the Law doth ſuperinduce that civil hereditary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon the blood of <hi>C.</hi> by his birth in <hi>England,</hi> tho' as he took it from his Father and Mother it was void of that Quality; the Law of Nature made him indeed Son, but it was the Law of <hi>England</hi> that gave him a capacity to be an Heir in <hi>England,</hi> or to have one.</p>
                     <p>My third and laſt Reaſon is indeed more general, tho' not ſo concluſive as the two former were upon the particular Reaſon of the Caſe, tho' not altogether to be neglected. <hi>(viz.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Law of <hi>England</hi> which is the only ground, and muſt be the only meaſure of the incapacity of an <hi>Alien,</hi> and of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential reſults that ariſe from it, hath been always very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the conſtruction of the diſability, and rather contracting than extending it ſo ſeverely.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtance,</p>
                     <p>The Statute <hi>de natis ultra Mare 25 E. 3.</hi> declares that the Iſſue born beyond Sea of an <hi>Engliſh Man</hi> upon an <hi>Engliſh Woman</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Denizen,</hi> yet the conſtruction hath been, tho' an <hi>Engliſh

                     </p>
                     <p>The Caſe of the <hi>Poſtnati,</hi> commonly called <hi>Calvin's Caſe,</hi> the Report is grounded upon this gentle Interpretation of the <hi>Law,</hi> tho' there were very witty <hi>Reaſons</hi> urged to the contrary; and ſurely if ever there were reaſon for a gentle Conſtruction even in the Caſe in queſtion, it concerns us to be guided by ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation ſince the Vnion of the two <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> by which many perthance very Conſiderable and Noble Families of a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Extract may be concerned in the conſequence of this Queſtion both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that enjoy their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in peace. I ſpare to mention particulars. So far there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the parallel Caſes of <hi>Attainder</hi> warrant this extent of this Ability I ſhall not diſpute, but further than that I dare not extend.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching the Authorities that favour my Opinion, I ſhall not mention them, becauſe they have been fully Repeated; and the later Authorities in this very Caſe are not in my Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be neglected.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Caſe of <hi>Godfrey and Dixon,</hi> it is true it doth differ from the Caſe in queſtion, and in that the Father was made a <hi>Denizen</hi> and then had Iſſue a younger Son, who inherited the elder Son an Alien born, but <hi>Naturalized</hi> after the death of his Father; yet there is to be obſerved in that Caſe, either the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization</hi> of the elder Son relates to his <hi>Birth,</hi> or relates only to the <hi>Time</hi> of his <hi>Naturalization;</hi> whether it did relate, or not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the words of the Act of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> which I have not ſeen.</p>
                     <p>If it did relate, the Cauſe in effect will be no more, but an Alien hath Iſſue a Natural born Son, (for ſo he is, as I have Argued, by his <hi>Naturalization</hi>) and then is made a Denizen, and hath Iſſue and dies, the elder Son purchaſeth Lands and dies without Iſſue, the younger Son ſhall inherit; the elder ſhould not have inherited his Father, by reaſon of the Incapacity of the Father.</p>
                     <p>But it doth not relate further than the <hi>Time</hi> of his <hi>Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which was after the time of the Death of his Father, and conſequently he could not diveſt the <hi>Heirſhip</hi> of his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet if he purchaſeth and dies without Iſſue, his younger Brother ſhall inherit him, tho' there was never <hi>Inheritable Blood</hi> between the elder Son and his Father, ſo much as in fiction or relation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:51792:214"/>Vpon the whole Caſe I conclude,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there be two Brochers Natural born in <hi>England,</hi> the Sons of an Alien, the one ſhall inherit the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Naturalization</hi> puts them in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as if born here, tho' it does not more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>George</hi> ſtands in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of inheriting his Vncle, the Earl, as <hi>George</hi> ſhould have done had he ſurvived the Earl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But if the Diſability of <hi>Robert</hi> the Father had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled the <hi>Brothers</hi> to have inherited one the other, the <hi>Naturalization</hi> of the Earl or <hi>George</hi> had not removed that Diſability.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But no ſuch Diſability of the Father doth diſable the Brother <hi>George</hi> to inherit the Earl; it neither doth <hi>Conſequentially</hi> diſable <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>George</hi> to inherit the Earl.</p>
                     <p>Conſequently, as to the Point referred to our Iudgment, <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>George</hi> is Inheritable to the Land of <hi>John</hi> his Vncle.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>Robert Ramſey,</hi> Born in <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Acceſſion thereof to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> had Iſſue four Sons, <hi>Robert, Nicholas, John</hi> and <hi>George, Antenati; Robert</hi> died (they do not find when) leaving Iſſue three Daughters, <hi>Margaret, Iſabel</hi> and <hi>Jane,</hi> who were alſo Aliens, and alive <hi>1 Octob. 14 Car. 1.

                        <hi>Nicholas Ramſey</hi> was alive at the making of that Act. <hi>John</hi> the third Son (afterwards <hi>Earl of Holderneſs</hi>) was <hi>Naturalized</hi> by Act of Parliament in <hi>England 1 Jacobi,</hi> and purchaſed the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Rectory</hi> in queſtion; and being ſeiſed <hi>22 Jac</hi> by <hi>Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Tripartite,</hi> between him of the Firſt part, Sir <hi>William Cocke</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> his Daughter of the Second part, and <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Effingham</hi> of the Third part; In Conſideration of a <hi>Marriage</hi> to be had between him and <hi>Martha,</hi> did Covenant to levy a <hi>Fine</hi> to the uſe of himſelf for Life, and afterwards to <hi>Martha</hi> for Life, the Remainder to the <hi>Heirs Males</hi> of his Body, the Remainder to his own right <hi>Heirs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>29 Septemb. 22 Jac.</hi> the <hi>Marriage</hi> was had, and the <hi>Michaelmas Term</hi> after a <hi>Fine</hi> was Levied accordingly. The <hi>24</hi> of <hi>Jan. 1 Car. 1.</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> died without Iſſue, <hi>Martha</hi> Entred and was ſeiſed for her Life, and died <hi>17 Car. Et eodem anno</hi> it was found by <hi>Office,</hi> that the <hi>Earl of Holderneſs</hi> died ſeiſed of the <hi>Rectory,</hi> as before, and without an <hi>Heir;</hi> and that King <hi>Charles (anno decimo)</hi> granted this <hi>Rectory</hi> to one <hi>Murray.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George</hi> (the fourth Son of <hi>Robert</hi>) was <hi>Naturalized</hi> by the <hi>Parliament</hi> here <hi>7 Jac.</hi> He had Iſſue <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Defendant. Nicholas</hi> died. <hi>Patrick</hi> his <hi>Heir</hi> in <hi>1651.</hi> bargained and ſold to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Elgin</hi> and one <hi>Sydenham, virtute cujus &amp; vigore Statuti, &amp;c.</hi> they were ſeiſed <hi>prout Lex poſtulat;</hi> and in <hi>1662.</hi> bargained and ſold for years to <hi>Amabel</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Jane Hart;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Releaſed to them and their <hi>Heirs</hi> in <hi>1665.</hi> They being ſeiſed, bargained and ſold by Leaſe and Releaſe alſo to <hi>Pullen</hi> and <hi>Neale,</hi> who Entred, and bargained and ſold to Sir <hi>Lionel Talmaſh</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> the <hi>Leſſors</hi> of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> upon whom <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> Entred.</p>
                     <p>Vpon which the Action is brought, and the great Queſtion in the Caſe was, <hi>Whether <hi>Patrick</hi> the Son of <hi>Nicholas</hi> might claim theſe Lands, as Heir to the Earl of <hi>Holderneſs,</hi> by virtue of the Act of Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 10 <hi>Car.</hi> or that they ſhould deſcend to the Defendant the Son of <hi>George,</hi> Naturalized the 7 of <hi>Jac.</hi> in <hi>England?</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wyld</hi> and <hi>Archer</hi> (who Argued firſt) were of Opinion, That however the Point was adjudged the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> could not have <hi>Judgment</hi> upon this <hi>Verdict;</hi> for they do not find that <hi>Patrick</hi> entred or was ſeiſed, but that he in <hi>1651.</hi> did bargain and ſell, &amp;c. <hi>Virtute cujus</hi> the <hi>Bargainees</hi> were ſeiſed <hi>prout Lex poſtulat;</hi> and then bargained and ſold in <hi>1662,</hi> and do not ſo much as find their <hi>Bargainees</hi> ſeiſed <hi>prout Lex poſtulat:</hi> But they find the <hi>Defendant</hi> Entred, and ſo the <hi>primer Poſſeſſion</hi> is in him, which is a good <hi>Title</hi> againſt the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> for whom none is found, it not being found that <hi>Patrick</hi> Entred.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51792:240"/>Again, If the <hi>Naturalization</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> will ſerve in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> appears for the Daughters, the Heirs of <hi>Robert</hi> the eldeſt Son; for 'tis found that he died, but not when, ſo it might be after the Act of <hi>10 Car.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> and <hi>Vaughan Chief Juſtice,</hi> differed in theſe two Points.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ſaid it would be intended; <hi>Patrick</hi> entred for a <hi>Verdict</hi> that leaves all the Matter at large to the Iudgment of the <hi>Court,</hi> will be taken ſometimes by <hi>Intendment,</hi> as well as where the <hi>Jury</hi> Conclude upon a <hi>Special Point. 2 Cro. 64.</hi> find an <hi>Incumbent</hi> Reſigned, the <hi>Reſignation</hi> ſhall be intended accepted. So in <hi>4 Co. Fullwood's Caſe</hi> it was found, that one came before the <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Mayor</hi> of the <hi>Staple, &amp; recognovit ſe debere, &amp;c.</hi> and did not ſay, <hi>per ſcriptum ſuum Obligatorium, nec per formam Statuti,</hi> yet intended ſo. <hi>Vid. Hob. 262.</hi> And where they find the <hi>Bargainees</hi> ſeiſed <hi>prout lex poſtulat,</hi> that doth not leave it doubtful whether ſeiſed or no, but whether by right or wrong; for <hi>Seiſin</hi> muſt be taken as found expreſly. Neither do they find any other in poſſeſſion, nor that the <hi>Defendant</hi> made any Claim in <hi>Twelve years</hi> after, which enforces the <hi>Intendment</hi> as before: And it is found expreſly that <hi>Pullen</hi> and <hi>Neale</hi> Entred in <hi>1665.</hi> ſo that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had not the <hi>primer Poſſeſſion,</hi> however, or if he had, he ſhould not have <hi>Judgment</hi> if no other <hi>Title</hi> were found for him, as is Reſolved in <hi>1 Cro. 42. Hern and Allen's Caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Second,</hi> It ſhall be intended <hi>Robert</hi> died before <hi>10 Car.</hi> For he is found an <hi>Alien,</hi> and ſhall be preſumed to have continued ſo during his Life, unleſs found to the contrary; then the <hi>Diſcent</hi> to the Daughters is obſtructed by the <hi>Incapacity</hi> of their Father. And tho' when the <hi>Title</hi> is found for the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> ſhall adjudge for him; becauſe the <hi>Kings Courts</hi> are intruſted with his <hi>Rights,</hi> 'tis not ſo of any other perſon: but they ſhall take no notice of any <hi>Title</hi> found for a <hi>Stranger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore they held (notwithſtanding theſe Omiſſions in the <hi>Verdict</hi>) that <hi>Judgment</hi> might be given for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Tyrrell</hi> was of Opinion, in the <hi>Principal Matter,</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> In his Argument he conſidered of divers kinds of <hi>Allegiance</hi> natural and acquired, which was either local or legal; As when a man is Sworn in the <hi>Leet, Denizated</hi> by the Kings <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> obtained by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> or <hi>Naturalized,</hi> which <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization</hi> muſt be by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and cannot be limited, <hi>2 Cro. 539. 1 Inſt. 129.</hi> who is to all purpoſes a Natural born Subject. An Indictment of <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt ſuch an one is <hi>contra naturalem ligeantiam.</hi> Neither can it be confined to Place; for 'tis due to the Natural, and not to the Politick perſon of the <hi>King, Mo. 790.</hi> And the Plea of <hi>infra ligeantiam Regni ſui Angliae</hi> was rejected in

                        <hi>Calvin's Caſe</hi> in <hi>Co.</hi> and ſaid to be never heard of before. <hi>Idem eſt naſci, &amp; idem naturalizari.</hi> And he Argued, That in regard <hi>Ireland</hi> hath the like <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> that <hi>England</hi> hath, it hath alſo the ſame Power, and conceived that the <hi>Engliſh Laws</hi> were introduced by <hi>Parliament</hi> in King <hi>John</hi>'s time: For in the <hi>Charter 11 H. 3.</hi> it is recited, that <hi>Johannes quondam Rex Angliae duxit ſecum in Hiberniam Viros diſcretos &amp; legis peritos, quorum Communi Concilio &amp; ad inſtantiam Hibernentium ſtatuit, &amp;c. &amp; ex diuturnitate temporis omnia praeſumuntur ſolenniter eſſe acta.</hi> In the <hi>4 Inſt. 357.</hi> it appears that <hi>Parliaments</hi> were holden there before <hi>17 E. 3. 2 R. 3. 12. Hibernia habet Parliamentum, &amp; facium Leges.</hi> And in <hi>4 Inſt. 452.</hi> it is ſaid, they may <hi>Naturalize an Alien;</hi> and if they do ſo, he is all one with an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man born: As one that purchaſeth his <hi>Freedom</hi> in a <hi>Corporation,</hi> hath all <hi>Immunities</hi> as amply as he that is born a <hi>Member</hi> of it. Neither doth it follow from hence, that an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> could bind <hi>England;</hi> it is the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Cooperating with the <hi>Act,</hi> that gives the <hi>Naturalization</hi> an effect here. The <hi>Act</hi> is but <hi>remotio Impedimenti:</hi> As if one were Attainted by the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> there, he ſhould forfeit his <hi>Lands</hi> here, and if that <hi>Act</hi> were Repealed he ſhould be reſtored to them again; yet neither <hi>Act</hi> were oligative to <hi>England:</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> is <hi>cauſa remota,</hi> or <hi>ſine qua non;</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>cauſa proxima,</hi> and this of <hi>Naturalization</hi> was one of the Wonders of the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> As Legitimation of a <hi>Baſtard,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>The other three <hi>Juſtices</hi> were of a contrary Opinion, and Argued to this effect: that <hi>Ireland</hi> was a <hi>Conquered Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> compleated, if not begun in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's time; in whoſe time there is no Record of any <hi>Eſtabliſhment,</hi> and being a <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom</hi> they remained Governed by their own Laws, until King <hi>John (Anno 12 Regni ſui,</hi> by <hi>Charter,</hi> (for ſo they conceived it to be, and not by <hi>Parliament;</hi>) for it appears that the <hi>Nobles</hi> were ſworn, which is not uſual in <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> neither is it <hi>Teſte Rege in Parliamento)</hi> introduced the <hi>Engliſh Laws;</hi> yet it hath ever remained a diſtinct <hi>Kingdom, viz.</hi> from the bringing in the <hi>Laws</hi> by King <hi>John, M.

by any <hi>Statute</hi> ſince unleſs named, <hi>Dier 303.</hi> It is ſaid of Lands holden in <hi>Capite</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> that there ought to be ſeveral Liverties and by ſeveral Seals <hi>11 Ed. 4. 7.</hi> When the King went into <hi>Ireland</hi> it was held to be a Voyage Royal. And <hi>Wyld</hi> ſaid, Two Kingdoms could not be united but by Act of Parliament; and there ought to be reciprocal Acts; and ſo is my <hi>Lord Coke 4 Inſt. cap. Scotland.</hi> But this the Chief Iuſtice ſaid in his Argument, was not requiſite in caſe of a Conquered Nation, which hereby had loſt its Original Right of holding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; but he agreed in caſe of Kingdoms independent one upon the other. He ſaid he had a <hi>Charter</hi> whereby <hi>Gaſcoigne, Guyan</hi> and <hi>Callice</hi> were united to <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Ed. the 3ds time,</hi> and recited to be by mutual pact upon a Peace concluded, that <hi>Wales,</hi> was fully conquered in <hi>Ed. 1ſt.</hi> time: whereupon they all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>de alto &amp; baſſo</hi> to the King; and it appears he abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates ſome Laws, makes ſome new, and continues others, and <hi>Wales</hi> was united and conſolidated with <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>H. 8</hi> time by Act of Parliament here, but there was no Act on their part; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Ireland</hi> only a diſtinct Kingdom, but alſo ſubordinate. A Law enacted here to extend to all the Kings Dominions ſhall bind <hi>Ireland;</hi> Writs of Error have been always brought here to reverſe Iudgments in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and they naturally lie as the Chief Iuſtice ſaid into all ſubordinate Kingdoms, <hi>Fitz. tit. Aſſ. 562.</hi> A Writ of Error to reverſe a Iudgment given in an Aſſize in the County of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and <hi>21 H. 7. 31.

                     <p>So the <hi>Romans</hi> allowed Appeals out of every Province ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate unto them, as appears by the Caſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and 'tis againſt Nature that the Inferiour ſhould have any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Superiour; ſuppoſe a Bill of <hi>Naturalization</hi> were brought into <hi>Parliament</hi> here and rejected, and after it ſhould paſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould it have the ſame effect as if it had paſſed here? If this might have been, what needed the endeavours in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of King <hi>James's</hi> Reign to obtain an Act for the <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization of all Scots, and the Union of both Kingdoms,</hi> when an Act in <hi>Ireland</hi> would have been as effectual, and procured with much greater facility? Neither is the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> equal to that of <hi>England,</hi> for that might be aliened by an <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> and <hi>Guyan</hi> were by mutual Conſent, tho' the <hi>King</hi> cannot do it alone; therefore <hi>King John</hi>'s Grant to the Pope was held abſolutely void; but <hi>Ireland</hi> could not be transferred from the Sovereignty of <hi>England</hi> by any <hi>Act</hi> there, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcharge themſelves of their Subordination to <hi>England.

an Act were made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that it ſhould be lawful for <hi>J.

So the Law is, that no man can be naturalized here but by <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> here <hi>Naturalization</hi> is a great point of State-intereſt, therefore the King cannot do it by his Charter. And the inconvenience would be very great if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould extend hither; for tho' it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected we might obviate it if found to be ſo, by diſallowing their Acts, which, before they paſs there, are ſent hither and remitted under the Great Seal, and ſo we may repeal their Acts; yet it was ſaid the like Power, by conſequence, muſt be yielded to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and we cannot diſannul their Acts; ſo they ſhall introduce what Aliens they pleaſe amongſt us without controll.

                        <hi>Vaughan.</hi> 'Tis the pleaſure of my Brothers, that I deliver their Opinion in this Caſe, and what I do deliver, I do not deliver as their Opinion only, but as the Opinion of all the Iudges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for they have met together by the Kings Command ſeveral times to debate and conſider of this Caſe, and they all agree that no Conſultation be granted: This is a Caſe of great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perhaps the only Caſe which has been ſolemnly reſolved ſince the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> was made; there are but three Caſes concerning it, <hi>Man's</hi> Caſe, <hi>1 Cro. 228. Mo. 907. Parſon's</hi> Caſe, <hi>1 Inſt. 235.</hi> and <hi>Remington's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Hob. 181.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt in the firſt place premiſe, that perhaps if we the Iudges had been makers of the Law, this Queſtion had not been; but we are to proceed upon the Laws as made, and cannot alter them: This is not a thing of our promotion, and this I ſpeak to ſatisfie ſuch as might object againſt us, This Statute was made in a time when the <hi>Popes</hi> Power was warmly purſued, and Laws were then made, which in the circumſtances of another time would not have been made. I will firſt give the Reaſons the Iudges went upon in their Reſolution; and then I will alſo give ſome Reaſons to ſatisfie People abroad, for I know the Caſe will meet with many cenſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the former. Antiently the Kings Temporal Courts had nothing to do with the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, it was wholly of Eccleſiaſtical Coniſance; the Statute <hi>de Circumſpecte agatis,</hi> is, that the Temporal Iudges ſhould not puniſh the Spiritual Courts for holding Pleas of thoſe things <hi>quae mere ſunt ſpiritualia, viz. pro Fornicatione, Adulterio &amp; hujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi;</hi> and Sir <hi>Ed. Coke 2 Inſt. 488.</hi> expounding thoſe words, <hi>Et hujuſmodi,</hi> he ſays, and he ſays very right, that theſe are to be taken for Offences of like nature, as the two Offences here particularly expreſſed, be, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſollicitation of any Womens Chaſtity, which is leſſer than theſe, and for Inceſt which is greater: Here is an undoubted evidence, that the Temporal Courts uſed to prohibit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ancientneſs of that is unqueſtioned; but it ſeems they did border in their Prohibitions, ſometimes upon things which were Spiritual, which they ought not to have done: There was no time but in which ſome Marriages were lawful and ſome unlawful; but if a man were formerly queſtioned about ſuch a matter, he had no relief from the Temporal Courts. By the Ancient Common Law, Marriages were unlawful as far as they had names of Kindred, <hi>viz. to the fourth Degree, from Couſin Germans incluſively,</hi> and therein it irritated the Civil Law; but in the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> it was ordained thus, <hi>Sancitum eſt prohibitionem copulationis conjugalis quartum gradum non excedere,</hi> and ſo it ſtands in all places under the Common Law at this day in Popiſh Countries;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51792:244"/>
with us it has received alteration by this Statute, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there is a Reaſon very much ſticks with many, <hi>viz. That the Temporal Courts are not skilled in the Laws by which this is to be judged, and therefore that it is not fit that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning it;</hi> 'Tis true, the word <hi>Cognitio</hi> ſignifies both, but yet there is a great difference between <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Cognizance,</hi> But I ſay further, That the Temporal Iudges may well enough have both; for though the knowledge of the Canon Law be not <hi>adequatum ſubjectum</hi> to a Common Lawyer, yet 'tis <hi>commune ſubjectum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are four Statutes which have made great alteration in the Cogniſance of this matter, <hi>25 H. 8. 22. 28 H. 8. c. 7. 28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> and this of <hi>32 H. 8. c. 38.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt indeed is repeaſed, becauſe it was interwoven with matter of Succeſſion of the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was ſet aſide. But the Second, <hi>viz. 28 H. 8. cap. 7.</hi> is ſyllabically the ſame as to this purpoſe; the words are, <hi>Since many inconveniences have faln, &amp;c. by reaſon of Marriages within the Degrees of Marriages prohibited by Gods Laws, that is to ſay, the Son to marry the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the Stepmother carnally known by his Father, the Brother the Siſter, the Father his Sons Daughter, or his Daughters Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Son to marry the Daughter of his Father, procreate and born by his Stepmother, or the Son to marry his Aunt, being his Fathers or Mothers Siſter, or to marry his Uncles Wife, carnally known by his Uncle, or the Father to marry the Sons Wife, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally known by his Son, or the Brother to marry the Brothers Wife, carnally known by his Brother, or any Man married, and carnally knowing his Wife, to marry his Wives Daughter, or his Wives Sons Daughter, or his Wives Daughters Daughter, or his Wives Siſter.</hi> So theſe Marriages are declared to be plainly prohibited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the Laws of God, and not to be diſpenſable with by any man; and therefore 'tis enacted that no perſon ſhall thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth marry within theſe Degrees, what pretence ſoever ſhall be made to the contrary thereof: And in caſe any perſon have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried within theſe Degrees, and by any the Archbiſhops or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be ſeparate from the Bond of ſuch Vnlawful Marriage, that every ſuch ſeparation ſhall be good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in caſe there be any perſon thus married, and be not yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, that every ſuch perſon ſhall be ſeparate by the definitive Sentence and Iudgment of the Archbiſhops, Biſhops and other Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> and by no other Power or Authority; and that all Sentences and Iudgments given, and to be given by any Archbiſhop, Biſhop or other Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be definitively firm, good and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to all intents, and obſerved and obeyed without ſuing any Provocations, Appeals, Prohibitions or other Proceſs from, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51792:245"/>
to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Derogation thereof, or contrary to the <hi>24 H. 6. c. 12.</hi> 'Tis very obſervable, and perhaps it has not been obſerved before, that the words of the Statute do not run ſo as commonly it ſeems, for if the words had been by reaſon of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying within (or againſt) the Prohibition of Marriage by Gods Laws, there had been <hi>little</hi> queſtion that there had been any other marriage againſt Gods Law (in the intention of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) but thoſe reckoned up; but the words are, <hi>marrying within the Degrees of Marriage</hi> prohibited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends that for the Son to marry the Mother is forbidden, and that for the Father to marry the Daughter is within the ſame Degree, tho' not expreſſed; ſo for a Grandſon to marry his Grandmother is within the ſame Degree of what is there forbidden: So whereas the Text, <hi>Leviticus 18. v. 14. forbids a man to marry his Fathers Brothers Wife,</hi> (for ſo the Text is) tho' the Statute expreſſes it <hi>his Uncles Wife;</hi> to marry the Mothers Brothers Wife is within the ſame Degree, tho' not mentioned in <hi>Leviticus, &amp;c.</hi> The Iudges did obſerve this only, but did give no Opinion concerning Marriages within the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees (<hi>viz.</hi> which are within the Degrees <hi>paritate rationis</hi> only, and are not expreſſed) ſuch as <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Manns</hi> and <hi>Reming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Caſe, in all which the Caſe was, a man married his firſt Wives Neice, which by Equity and Parity of Reaſon was perhaps within the Prohibition, <hi>ver. 12, 13. that a man ſhould not marry his Aunt,</hi> or rather the Prohibition, <hi>ver. 14. that a man ſhould not marry his Fathers Brothers Wife, &amp;c.</hi> but only in one particular, <hi>viz. that in the aſcending and deſcending Parental-Line, the Marriages are prohibited <hi>in infinitum,</hi>
                        </hi> but for the reſt which are in <hi>pari gradu</hi> to the Degrees there mentioned, they have not given any reſolution at this time.</p>
                     <p>Now as to this Caſe, in the ſecond Statute there is obſerved this difference, that the words <hi>carnally known</hi> are added, where the Prohibition is in reſpect of a former Marriage of one of the Parties, as <hi>the Son to marry the Stepmother, carnally known by his Father, or to marry his Uncles Wife, carnally known by his Uncle, &amp;c.</hi> this indeed is not particularly expreſſed and applied to every individual Prohibition, to which 'tis applicable in the firſt Statute; but methinks 'tis intended and as fully provided for (tho' in general) in the laſt Clauſe of the ſaid firſt Statute, which is this, <hi>provided always That the Article in this Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning Prohibition of Marriages within the Degree afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned in this Act, ſhall always be taken, interpreted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ſuch Marriages</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> I ſuppoſe former Marriages) <hi>where Marriages was ſolemnized and carnal knowledge was had</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51792:245"/>In neither of theſe two Acts is there any Power given to the <hi>Temporal Courts,</hi> to make any alteration as to the <hi>Canon Law;</hi> or <hi>God's Law;</hi> but it was referred to the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and the power of Diſpenſing <hi>de facto</hi> left in the ſame ſtate as before: And <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> were granted in theſe very particulars, which the <hi>Statute</hi> ſays ought not to be done.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third Law</hi> which concerns this Caſe is the <hi>28 H. 8. cap. 16.</hi> againſt <hi>Diſpenſations, &amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> by which all <hi>Marriages</hi> which ſtood upon theſe <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> became abſolutely unlawful; for the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> are made thereby clearly void, &amp;c. and therefore there is a proviſional <hi>Clauſe</hi> in it, <hi>That yet notwithſtanding at the moſt humble Petitions of the Lords and Commons, &amp;c. all Marriages had and ſolemnized before the 30th of <hi>November. Anno</hi> 26 of the Kings Reign, &amp;c. whereof there is no Divorce or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had by the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of this Realm, and which Marriages be not prohibited by God's Laws, limitted and declared in the Act made in this preſent Parliament, for the eſtabliſhing the King's Succeſſion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. aforementioned) or otherwiſe by Holy Scripture ſhall be, &amp;c. good, &amp;c. and reputed, taken and adjudged, &amp;c. as good, &amp;c. if no impediment of Matrimony had ever been between them that have contracted and ſolemnized ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Act had gone no further than theſe words <hi>(For the Eſtabliſhment of the King's Succeſſion)</hi> it had clearly brought the Cognizance of theſe <hi>Marriages</hi> to the <hi>Temporal Courts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 'tis Objected, That this Law made no ſuch alteration, becauſe of the words which are added, <hi>Or otherwiſe by Holy Scripture;</hi> for this 'tis ſaid makes it directly of the Cognizance of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> ſo that it leaves it to them who know what is lawful or unlawful by <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall forbear to Anſwer this until I come to the other Act, where indeed the very ſame <hi>Exception</hi> is; (for the words, <hi>Gods Law except,</hi> in that, is tantamount to theſe words) and then I will anſwer both.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>32 H. 8. cap. 38.</hi> on which the Queſtion is. This is <hi>Cardo Queſtionis,</hi> the miſchief before the <hi>Statute</hi> was, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had entangled and troubled the <hi>Kings Juriſdiction,</hi> and unquieted his <hi>Subjects</hi> by his Vſurped Power in making that unlawful which by <hi>Gods Word</hi> is lawful in <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore (as the <hi>Statute</hi> ſays) it was thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vement that two things eſpecially for that time ſhould be with diligence provided for.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Whereas divers Marriages had been diſſolved upon pretence of Precontracts not conſummate by Carnal Knowledge, that ſuch Marriages ſhould be good and indiſſoluble notwithſtanding any ſuch Precontract.</hi> But this Point is Repealed by te <hi>2 Ed. 6. cap. 23.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51792:246"/>Secondly, and this concerns the preſent Caſe, <hi>Whereas alſo Marriages were often diſſolved and brought into great incertainty, by reaſon of other Prohibitions than Gods Law admitteth.</hi> For the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for their lucre invented <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,</hi> the granting whereof they always reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Affinity</hi> between <hi>Couſin Germans,</hi> and ſo to <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth Degrees, &amp;c.</hi> which elſe were lawful, and be not prohibited by <hi>Gods Law;</hi> and all, becauſe they would get <hi>Money</hi> by it, &amp;c. It was Enacted, &amp;c. <hi>That from the firſt day, &amp;c. ut ſupra, it does declare all perſons to be lawful to Marry who are not prohibited by Gods Laws.</hi> If it had gone no further, or if the following words had not added or given ſomething more, it had been the ſame with the former <hi>Statutes,</hi> and liable to the ſame <hi>Objections,</hi> and the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> would have had no Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the matter. But the contrary is manifeſt; for had it been ſo, the <hi>Statute</hi> would have been of no uſe as the time then was: For the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> muſt have judged of it, and that they would have done by the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> For the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals (Gratian</hi> and <hi>Gregories)</hi> in which the Sum of the <hi>Canon Law</hi> conſiſts, (there is ſome little more, but they are the ſum) are nothing but the Determinations of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters</hi> upon <hi>Gods Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what proviſion had this been according to the Evil to be remedied? The words of <hi>Kindred</hi> were as far as the <hi>ſeventh Degree,</hi> and ſo far by the ancient <hi>Canon Law</hi> was the Prohibition of <hi>Marriage;</hi> and they grounded themſelves upon <hi>Levit. 18. ver. 6. None of you ſhall approach to any that is near of Kin to him, to uncover their Nakedneſs;</hi> and if they had had Words as far as the <hi>ſeventeenth Degree,</hi> they might have done the ſame. But that was Corrected, as I ſaid, by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran:</hi> And ſo it ſtood with us till this <hi>Statute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if this <hi>Statute</hi> gave no other direction or alteration in this matter, there was no reſtraint or probability, but that they might and would extend the Prohibition of <hi>Marriage</hi> as far as the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> Alſo, if the meaning of the <hi>Statute</hi> had been to prohibit in general <hi>Marriages</hi> againſt <hi>Gods Law,</hi> it had been to no purpoſe to expreſs the <hi>Levitical Degrees:</hi> For they who are prohibited by the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> are but a part of thoſe who are prohibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and the general Expreſſion would have ſerved the turn. 'Tis certain, the <hi>Statute</hi> meant to make all <hi>Marriages</hi> without the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> lawful, except ſome few which are excepted here by the words, <hi>Gods Law except;</hi> and in the former <hi>Statute</hi> by the words, <hi>Or otherwiſe by the Holy Scripture.</hi> For who will ſay now, taking the Words ſtrainedly and literally, that no <hi>Marriage</hi> ſhall be ſet aſide for impotency of Generation, or plurality of Husbands and Wives, or perhaps Adultery?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51792:246"/>There has been an Opinion in our Books, <hi>That if a Woman take two Husbands the Marriage is void, and there needs no ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Sentence; but if a Man take two Wives there has been ſome doubt.</hi> The firſt, that of the <hi>Woman</hi> is clear, the Words <hi>Gods Law except,</hi> did intend ſuch <hi>Marriages;</hi> and the ſame Anſwer would ſerve to Anſwer the ſame Conſequence that would follow out of the words in the former Act, by reaſon of the words <hi>Or otherwiſe by Holy Scripture.</hi> I give this as an Interpretation at preſent, tho' I ſhall give a fuller Anſwer preſently.</p>
                     <p>It was intended that no <hi>Marriage,</hi> as to <hi>Kindred</hi> or <hi>Affinity,</hi> ſhould be ſet aſide, but according to the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> and that is the ſcope of the <hi>Statute;</hi> for it had no aſpect to any other ſort of Impediment, if it had (as I obſerved) the General words would have done it more clearly.</p>
                     <p>But take this <hi>Statute</hi> in the largeſt Senſe, it has given the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> an undoubted Cognizance. Since the making of this <hi>Statute</hi> there has been no queſtion but that a <hi>Prohibition</hi> would lye in caſe of <hi>Couſin Germans Marriage,</hi> and ſo on, <hi>2 Inſt. 684.</hi> This is manifeſt indeed, becauſe the <hi>Statute</hi> does expreſly declare that ſuch <hi>Marriages</hi> are lawful and not prohibited by <hi>Gods Law:</hi> But this our Caſe is not ſo clear.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the plain Senſe is, that all <hi>Marriages</hi> are and ſhall be lawful and good, which are not prohibited by the <hi>Levitical</hi> or other part of Gods Law, (and this, as other <hi>Statutes,</hi> the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Courts</hi> are Conſervators of); the former <hi>Statutes</hi> were only directory to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts, viz. That they ſhould Divorce, and not admit of Diſpenſations, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This being made clear, that the <hi>Judges</hi> may grant <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> then the firſt Queſtion is, <hi>Whether any Marriages without the Levitical Degrees be unlawful and impeachable?</hi> And for that the Authority is in the Negative, <hi>1 Inſt. 235. a.</hi> By the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>32 H. 8. cap. 8.</hi> 'tis declared, <hi>That all perſons be lawful;</hi> that is, <hi>may lawfully marry, that be not prohibited by the Levitical Degrees.</hi> But this is not intended to extend to perſons which upon other accounts are prohibited by Gods Law to marry, as (at this time Perſons precontracted) Perſons under a perpetual Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, (whereof we have two Inſtances, <hi>Dyer 178.9.40.</hi>) And the truth is, as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays expreſly in <hi>2 Inſt. 687. Theſe Marriages</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are ſaid to be prohibited by Gods Law, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Statute of 32 H. 8. would extend unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We come now to this particular Caſe. Some would have this <hi>Marriage</hi> prohibited not by <hi>Leviticus 18. ver. 14.</hi> where the words are, <hi>Thou ſhalt not uncover the Nakedneſs of thy Fathers Brother: thou ſhalt not approach to his Wife, ſhe is thine Aunt.</hi> But by <hi>Levit. 20. ver. 20.</hi> where the words are, <hi>And if a man ſhall lye with his Uncles Wife, he hath uncovered his Uncles Nakedneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51792:247"/>But certainly this Caſe is no <hi>Prohibition,</hi> it ſerves only to declare the Puniſhment; for the immediate next words are, <hi>They ſhall dye Childleſs.</hi> This laſt <hi>Text</hi> is expreſſed <hi>vice verſa</hi> in reſpect to the firſt; but 'tis the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now the Reaſon the <hi>Judges</hi> went upon in this Caſe, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining this <hi>Marriage</hi> to be lawful is, becauſe 'its neither within an expreſs <hi>Prohibition,</hi> nor within any <hi>Degree</hi> there. If we ſhall admit any thing againſt this, there is no <hi>Repagulum</hi> or ſtay, we ſhall not know where to reſt, but it would go on as far as the <hi>Canon Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. A Great Uncle is an Uncle as well as an Immediate Uncle; and a man is forbid to <hi>uncover his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Nakedneſs,</hi> Lev. 20. ver. 20.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no ſuch <hi>Prohibition,</hi> that Expreſſion is but as a Conſequent of lying with his <hi>Uncles Wife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But read the words as you will, 'tis plain no other perſon is meant here, but the <hi>Fathers Brothers Wife,</hi> even the ſame as is mentioned <hi>Levit. 18. ver. 14.</hi> and this <hi>20th Verſe</hi> only meant to declare the puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is no other Prohibition in this <hi>20th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and why ſhould this be taken for one?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the <hi>Latin</hi> they have diſtinct words, as <hi>Patruus</hi> and <hi>Avunculus</hi> to expreſs <hi>Uncles</hi> by; but in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> they ſay, (for I will not pretend skill in what I have none) they have no ſuch diſtinct words, nor has the <hi>Septuagint</hi> any ſuch; the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. I have looked upon the laſt and beſt, the <hi>Paris Edition;</hi> the words run thus: <hi>Qui cubaverit cum Cognata ſua retexit pubertatem Cognatae ſuae:</hi> But I rely upon <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremilius,</hi> whoſe <hi>Tranſlation</hi> is done with great Care, they have the ſame words in both places, <hi>viz. Nuditatem Patrui;</hi> and the whole current of <hi>Tranſlations</hi> run ſo. The word <hi>Uncle</hi> is an Equivocal word; in our <note n="*" place="margin">Welſh.</note> Language (the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Language) a <hi>Grandfather,</hi> or <hi>Great Grandfathers Couſin German</hi> is called an <hi>Uncle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Argument à <hi>fortiori,</hi> whether or how far <hi>Nata</hi> is to be received I ſhall take notice preſently.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing I muſt obſerve, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>Churchmen</hi> ſhould not object to us, that this is <hi>Falcem immittere in alienam Meſſem;</hi> becauſe were it not for the <hi>Statute,</hi> it would be hard to make out by perſons of what Learning ſoever, that we are obliged to the <hi>Levitical Degrees:</hi> For we are not bound by the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> and how comes this part of it to be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, I mean thoſe of the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> which are of the <hi>Judicial, poſitive Law</hi> only? For there are ſome of theſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51792:247"/>
ſuch, as that <hi>Marriages</hi> within them were prohibited from the beginning of <hi>Time:</hi> But the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land, <hi>(viz.) 28 H. 8. cap. 7.</hi> has declared, <hi>That all Marriages within thoſe Degrees are prohibited by the Laws of God;</hi> (indeed the <hi>Statute</hi> in its decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration does include all that is prohibited in <hi>Leviticus:</hi>) But I muſt obſerve too, that the <hi>Statute</hi> does in this particular declare more and otherwiſe than is declared in the <hi>Scripture; (viz.)</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> declares generally Marriage with a mans <hi>Brothers Wife</hi> to be prohibited by Gods Law; but 'tis certain that was not ſo generally prohibited, for it was with this Circumſtance, <hi>If the Brother had Iſſue;</hi> for if he had none, the <hi>Brother</hi> was commanded to <hi>take her to Wife and raiſe up Seed to his Brother, Deut. 25. ver 5. Matt. 22. ver. 24. Mark 12. ver. 19. Luke 20. ver. 28.</hi> But now this is abſolutely prohibited by our Law, tho' but qualified by theirs.</p>
                     <p>Another is ſaid to be prohibited, <hi>(viz.) To marry a man's Wives Siſter:</hi> But that was not ſo amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> where this was the Law of the <hi>Forum,</hi> the <hi>Practical Law;</hi> but it was only during her Life, and ſo is the Text. <hi>Lev. 18. ver. 18. Neither ſhalt thou take a Wife to her Siſter to vex her, to uncover her Nakedneſs, beſides the other in her Lifetime.</hi> For <hi>Bigamy</hi> and <hi>Poligamy</hi> with <hi>Non prohibited Perſons</hi> were allowed there.</p>
                     <p>So that theſe things are not ſo truly of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi> becauſe there are things declared to be prohibited here, which are not by Gods Law <hi>(otherwiſe.)</hi> Now to conſider how this Law in <hi>Leviticus</hi> ſhall be extended and expounded, the cleareſt way how to underſtand any Law is by what was the Story and Iudgment of thoſe <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Times</hi> in which it was practical. To examine this Law by the <hi>Civil Law</hi> or <hi>Canon Law,</hi> is as wide and as bad as to examine it by the <hi>Indian Law,</hi> or <hi>Perſian Law;</hi> therefore the <hi>Judges</hi> have conſidered what was the Opinion and Iudgment of the <hi>Jews;</hi> (this I obſerve to ſhew the Care of the <hi>Judges</hi>) and eſpecially they have conſulted Mr. <hi>Selden's Uxor Hebraica,</hi> the <hi>ſix firſt Chapters,</hi> there it appears that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> interpreted this Law <hi>Literally;</hi> but the <hi>Prudentes</hi> and the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> did make other Prohibitions, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fepimenta Legis:</hi> But this <hi>Degree</hi> in this Caſe is not even amongſt thoſe. Then there were others, the <hi>Karmites,</hi> who held that theſe <hi>Degrees</hi> were mentioned only for Inſtance, and that ſeveral others are within the Prohibition <hi>paritate rationis;</hi> and what they ſay (ſave in two or three particulars) is the ſame with our <hi>Parochial Tables,</hi> and probably at the firſt this <hi>Table</hi> came thence from that Example into the <hi>Chriſtian Churches.</hi> Now the firſt is of incomparable Authority above the latter, for they had <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Authority, <hi>Matt. 23. ver. 23.</hi> but the others were a <hi>Sect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51792:248"/>It was agreed, as I ſaid, that Marriages in the <hi>aſcending</hi> an <hi>deſcending Line, i.e.</hi> of <hi>Children,</hi> with their Father, Grandfather, their Mother, Grandmother, and ſo upwards, are prohibited without limit: But the prohibition of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which is in queſtion here, <hi>(viz.)</hi> with an <hi>Uncles Relict,</hi> is not to be extended beyond the <hi>Degree</hi> which is expreſſed. The Reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe, I will ſhew</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Reaſon of the <hi>Prohibition</hi> to marry a mans <hi>Parent</hi> is, becauſe they are the Cauſe of his Being; the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> indeed are the <hi>immediate Cauſe,</hi> but the <hi>Grandfather</hi> and <hi>Grandmother, &amp;c.</hi> are the <hi>Cauſe</hi> too tho' <hi>mediate;</hi> he could not be that which he is without them, and if he be obliged to the one, he is to the other: But a man is no more obliged to his <hi>Uncle</hi> for his Being, than if the <hi>Uncle</hi> had never been. The Reaſon why a man is prohibited to marry his <hi>Uncle's Wife</hi> is, becauſe 'tis expreſly named.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Reaſon of the <hi>Prohibition</hi> in the firſt Caſe is, <hi>That ſuch a Marriage is againſt Nature;</hi> but not as 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken. For as we commonly talk of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> it is <hi>Pons ſtulrorum,</hi> when Fools can't tell which way to go further they go there; for by <hi>Nature</hi> 'tis not poſſible for a <hi>Child</hi> to know his <hi>Parent</hi> (he comes to that knowledge by Laws and Reputation, and therefore the <hi>Theban</hi> Story might well be true, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Oedipus</hi> being bred from his Parents, might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly kill his Father <hi>Laius</hi> and marry his Mother <hi>Jocaſta. He is a wiſe Son that knows his Father,</hi> our <hi>Proverb</hi> ſays: So neither can the <hi>Father</hi> know his <hi>Son,</hi> tho' the <hi>Mother</hi> may, (at leaſt better than the <hi>Father</hi>); but with another thing ſuppoſed, 'tis Naturally unlawful, one (that knows his <hi>Relation</hi>) ought not to marry his <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Child,</hi> it is againſt <hi>Nature.</hi> There is neither Servant or Maſter in <hi>Nature,</hi> but thoſe Obligations are induced thereupon by <hi>Contract, &amp;c.</hi> But ſuppoſing a man cannot be Maſter and Servant to the ſame perſon at the ſame time, becauſe there is a repugnancy in it; ſo a man cannot be <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Husband, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe there is a repugnancy in the Offices. A <hi>Parent</hi> cannot obey a <hi>Child,</hi> and therefore 'tis unnatural a <hi>Parent</hi> ſhould be <hi>Wife</hi> to a <hi>Child.</hi> A Parent, as a <hi>Parent,</hi> may Command and Correct a <hi>Child,</hi> and there there a <hi>Child,</hi> as <hi>Husband,</hi> ſhould Command and Correct the ſame <hi>Parent,</hi> is utterly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>Vnder the <hi>Law</hi> the Son that <hi>Curſed</hi> his Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Levit. 20. ver. 9.</hi> and alſo he that was <hi>Diſobedient</hi> to either of them, <hi>Deut. 21. ver. 18, 19, 20, 21.</hi> was to <hi>be put to death.</hi> And as there is a <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> due to the <hi>Immediate Parents,</hi> ſo there is to <hi>Grand Parents;</hi> if the <hi>Immediate Parent</hi> have an abſolute or qualified Power over the Son, the <hi>Grand
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51792:248"/>
Parent</hi> has the like over the Son too; becauſe the <hi>Grand Parent</hi> hath it over the <hi>Immediate Parent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I will cite a Caſe in our Law ſomewhat to the purpoſe I have been ſpeaking, 'tis in <hi>Platt's Caſe, Pl. Com. 37. a.</hi> If a Woman be <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and one that is in Priſon there marry her, he is thereby out of Priſon, and the Law does adjudge him to be Enlarged; becauſe 'tis repugnant that he as <hi>Husband</hi> ſhould have the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> of her, and ſhe as <hi>Gaoler</hi> the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> of him. And the like Reaſon, at leaſt in ſome degree, is againſt <hi>Parents</hi> marrying their <hi>Daughters, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now as to all this, I will cite one of the greateſt Human Authorities. It is the Opinion of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> the Learnedeſt man of his time, <hi>De jure Belli ac Pacis, lib. 2. cap. 5, &amp; 12. Ab hac generalitate</hi> (ſays he) <hi>eximo matrimonia parentum cujuſcunque gradus cum liberis, quae quo minus licita ſunt rati (ni fallor) ſatis apparet, nam nec maritus qui ſuperior eſt lege matrimonii eam reverentiam poteſt praeſtari matri quam natura exigit, nec patri filia; quia quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam inferior eſt in matrimonio, ipſum tamen matrimonium talem inducit ſocietatem quae illius neceſſitudinis reverentiam excludit.</hi> The Reverence on each ſide is inconſiſtent. But this Reaſon holds not againſt the marriage of a man's <hi>Uncles Wife;</hi> and the ſame very Great Perſon gives his Opinion to this purpoſe a little before; <hi>De conjugiis eorum qui ſanguine aut affinitate jungun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut ſatis gravis eſt quaeſtio, &amp; non rato magnis motibus agitata; nam cauſas certas ac naturales cur talia conjugia, ita ut legibus aut moribus vetantur illicita ſint, aſſignate qui voluerit, experiendo diſcet, quam id ſit difficile, imo praeſtari non poſſit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another Reaſon of the Vnlawfulneſs or Prohibition of <hi>Marriages</hi> of the firſt kind (which holds not in this Caſe) is the inconſiſtence, abſurdity and monſtrouſneſs of the <hi>Relations</hi> to be begotten by them, the Son would be his <hi>Fathers Brother,</hi> his <hi>Mothers Grandſon,</hi> his own <hi>Uncle, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. In the Civil Law Uncles are <hi>Loco Parentum?</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were ſo eſtimated there; but thence it doth not follow that they are ſo. But I will give the true Reaſon why they were ſo called, <hi>(viz.)</hi> They, the <hi>agnati</hi> are <hi>legitimi Tutores</hi> of the <hi>Brothers Children;</hi> and this appears by <hi>Juſtinian:</hi> But how abſurd is it to apply this to the Matter? Why, by the ſame Reaſon the <hi>Guardian</hi> in our Law can't marry his <hi>Ward,</hi> let the <hi>Degree</hi> be what it will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. The <hi>Canon Law</hi> does prohibit the ſame alſo, becauſe they are <hi>Loco Parentum?</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Reaſon is borowed from the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and muſt have the ſame Anſwer. There is another thing very remarkable as to this diſtinction, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that our Law puts a great difference between <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Uncles;</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> can't inherit the <hi>Son,</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51792:249"/>
but the <hi>Uncle</hi> may. So that the meaſure to be taken by and from the Laws of one Kingdom to another, is quite different.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Synod</hi> held by the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Canterbury, Anno 1603.</hi> there were certain <hi>Canons</hi> made: The <hi>Synod</hi> was called by the Kings <hi>Writ,</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> ratified as they ought to be. In the <hi>99th Canon</hi> of thoſe it is Ordained, <hi>That no perſon ſhall marry within any Degrees expreſſed in the Table there mentioned.</hi> This <hi>Table</hi> was firſt ſet up after this <hi>Canon;</hi> but it had been publiſhed by <hi>Proclamation, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Queens</hi> time. This <hi>Canon</hi> is ſo penned that it muſt be underſtood, that all the <hi>Degrees</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed there within which Marriage was intended to be prohibited; but now there is no ſuch <hi>Degree</hi> as this in the preſent Caſe there. I do not take the Pleading in this Caſe to be good; becauſe here it is not ſaid, <hi>ſhe was Carnally known,</hi> as before I obſerved it ought to be, to bring him within the Statute, then there is a Fault in the <hi>Plaintiffs;</hi> for tho' they have ſet down the Caſe ſo that we can ſee what it is, yet they ought to have averred that it was not within the <hi>Levitical Degrees;</hi> becauſe that then they might have given opportunity to the <hi>Defendant</hi> to aſſign ſome other Cauſe, <hi>Bene &amp; verum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> but ſhe had married a former <hi>Husband</hi> before, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to the other ſort of <hi>Objections,</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give ſome Reaſons in anſwer of, for the ſatisfaction of of People abroad.</p>
                     <p>I did ſay, That it were very difficult, without this Statute, to make it out, that we were bound to obſerve this part of the Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law: And we are not bound to obſerve any part of the Iudaical Law, (except thoſe particulars where there is a Natural Reaſon too.) <hi>Acts Apoſt. 15.</hi> There is the account of a <hi>Council</hi> held concerning the <hi>keeping of the Moſaical Law,</hi> and the reſult is, That it ſeems good to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to lay upon their Brethren (which were of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in <hi>Antioch, &amp;c.</hi>) no greater burthen than theſe neceſſary things, <hi>That the abſtained from Meats offered to Idols, Blood, things ſtrangled, and Fornication.</hi> A man can't ſay that all theſe were <hi>Moſaical</hi> neither; but it is plain theſe were all they would lay upon them and the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi> 'Tis clear, they were not given as <hi>Precepts,</hi> but <hi>Counſels,</hi> that the <hi>Communion</hi> between the <hi>two Churches</hi> which were then coming together might not be interrupted, <hi>Cor. 10. ver. 17, &amp;c. Whatſoever is ſet before you eat, asking no Queſtion for Conſcience ſake: But if any man ſay unto you, This is offered in ſacrifice unto Idols, eat not for his ſake that ſhew'd it, and for Conſcience ſake, &amp;c. Conſcience I ſay, not thine own, but the others, &amp;c. Give none offence, neither to the <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 2. ver. 14.</hi> does clearly affirm, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not given to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51792:249"/>
                        <hi>Rom. 3. v. 2.</hi> ſhews that this Law called there <hi>the Oracle of God,</hi> was committed to the <hi>Jews</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> (And this is the great Objection againſt our Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions) <hi>This Law depends upon the Original Tongues and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Hiſtory; and Laymen cannot know the Secret of this Law by which this matter is to be decided.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection hath ſome ſpeciouſneſs in it, but no weight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Levitical Law is generally underſtood, to be that which is publickly received as the Tranſlation; all Laws that are made concerning any ſuch thing, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that kind of the thing which is vulgarly and generally known and received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> And 'tis not long ſince the Clergy came to be ſo learned, they were content heretofore with the Vulgar Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and 'tis not neceſſary for a Dean (for that purpoſe) or other Dignitary or Clergyman, <hi>quaſi</hi> ſuch, that he ſhould underſtand the Languages. But,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have no Cognizance of this Matter; there was a time when they had no cognizance of Wills and Teſtaments (but now they have, they muſt ſtudy them, and determine concerning them.) Since we have a Cognizance, we may as well prohibit in this Caſe of Land Freehold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For ſince this is made of the ſame nature, we muſt go the ſame way: If an Act were made, that in matter of Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhould judge after the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we muſt ſtudy it, and judge by it. 'Tis no new thing that Laws be thus transferred from one Nation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; thus was the Law of the Twelve Tables from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> thus the Law of <hi>Rhodes</hi> to other parts of the World, and ſo our Law was made the Law of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and this is the Anſwer I give to the two Statutes, that ſince we have Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance we muſt take notice of Gods Law. If Churchmen in this caſe encroach Iuriſdiction, they muſt be prohibited, becauſe they have no Cognizance, and we have, tho' their accidental Learning may be more than ours.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>'Tis hard that this ſhould be a Prohibiting Law any more than thoſe two other Statutes, which 'tis agreed were directive only (to the Spiritual Courts) and gave the Temporal Courts no Juriſdiction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a full and flat anſwer to this; this Statute makes it not at all cogniſable by them, for where any Court has Cognizance the party muſt have Proceſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now here in the cloſe of this Statute, 'tis enacted, <hi>That no Perſon, &amp;c. ſhall be admitted to any of the Spiritual Courts, &amp;c. to any Proceſs, Plea or Allegation contrary to this foreſaid Act:</hi> And therefore all Cognizance of that nature is taken away from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51792:250"/>
them. They have Cognizance of all Marriages within the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Degrees</hi> (we allow and agree) to diſturb and puniſh the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but they have no Cognizance nor Power to determine what is within the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> and what not.</p>
                     <p>I conclude, It is the Opinion of this Court and of all the Iudges, that the Prohibition do ſtand, and no Conſultation be granted.</p>
                     <p>In this Caſe Dr. <hi>Stern</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> was very zealous and induſtrious to ſet aſide the Prohibition. He made ſeveral and diſtinct applications to the Iudges about it; he earneſtly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly debated the matter with them, and gave them Papers of his Arguments and Reaſons to prove this Marriage inceſtuous and unlawful.</p>

                     <head>Thomas Rudyards Caſe.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THomas Rudyard,</hi> an Attorney of this Court, came into this Court upon the retorn of an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> directed to the Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> who retorned, that he was taken and detained by virtue of a Warrant to him directed from Sir <hi>Samuel Sterling Lord Mayor,</hi> and Sir <hi>J.

R.</hi> Gent. hath been brought before Us, and examined touching ſeveral Miſdemeanours by him committed within the City of <hi>London</hi> ſince the Month of <hi>April</hi> and before the 4th of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>June,</hi> and to Us complained of, and more particularly for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and ſtirring up of His Majeſties Subjects, then and there, to the diſobedience of his Laws, and for abetting and encouraging of ſuch as do meet in unlawful and ſeditious Conventicles, contrary to the form of the late Statute made in the 22th Year of our Sovereign Lord the King that now is; upon whoſe Examination we find juſt cauſe to ſuſpect him to be guilty of the ſaid Miſdemeanours, and thereupon did require him to find Sureties to be of the good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which he refuſed: Theſe are therefore to require you to take into your Cuſtody the Body of the ſaid <hi>T. R.</hi> and him ſafely to keep till he be from thence delivered by due Courſe of Law, Given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Hands and Seals this 11th day of <hi>June</hi> 1670.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Retorn being filed and ſpoken to by the Counſel upon two ſeveral days, the Court delivered their Opinion <hi>Seriatim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wyld</hi> held that he ought to be remanded, for if the Warrant had been that he appeared to be guilty, or that they had found him guilty; then the Commitment had been good, as hath been agreed on all Hands, and here the words in a favourable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction amount to as much. The proceedings of the Magiſtrates againſt ſuch Seditious Perſons are to be encouraged, eſpecially in ſuch a time as this, when 'tis known they are grown to ſuch a head.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51792:250"/>
                        <hi>Archer, contra,</hi> For 'tis altogether uncertain; 'tis ſaid he was complained of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not that he did any thing, and that they find juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, but ſhew not the Cauſe in particular: If it had been ſaid ſundry Miſdemeanours, and not expreſſed what, all would agree it inſufficient, as <hi>Chambers</hi> Caſe, <hi>1 Cro.</hi> and <hi>Wolnoths</hi> Caſe, <hi>ibid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden, 3 Car.</hi> was required to find Sureties for the good Behaviour, for which the Iudges were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reprehended in full Parliament becauſe no ſufficient Cauſe appeared: Tho' the Iuſtices here had ſufficient Cauſe to induce their ſuſpicion, they ought upon the Retorn to have ſignified it to the Court for their ſatisfaction alſo; it ſhould have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed alſo in what ſum they required him to find Sureties, that it might have appeared to be reaſonable, ſo that we cannot remand him; but I think 'tis fit to oblige him to Bail to appear the firſt day of the next Term, that he may anſwer ſuch things as ſhall be objected againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> It is the Statute of <hi>34 E. 3. c. 1.</hi> that enables Iuſtices of the Peace to require Sureties for the good Behaviour, and that upon Suſpition, and ſeems to refer it to their Diſcretion, but that muſt be exerciſed according to Law, and whether it be or no, the Iudges in this Hall muſt judge, and therefore the matters ought to be certainly certified to them. The preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn is altogether uncertain, wherefore I think it ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, but I would adviſe him to conſider the Statute of <hi>35 Eliz. c. 1.</hi> againſt impugners of the Kings Authority in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vaughan,</hi> Chief Iuſtice, This Caſe is one of the niceſt that ever I met with; on the one ſide is the conſideration of diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sectaries, and preſerving of the Publick Peace and Quiet of the Government. On the other ſide the Legal Right which every one hath to his Liberty. Whoever excites the People to the diſobedience of a Law, commits the Higheſt Offence under High Treaſon. I do not mean every Law, as if one which ſhould cauſe a Treſpaſs to be done, ſhould be ſo guity, but Laws which are of a publick Nature.</p>
                     <p>As to the Retorn I think it is the moſt inſufficient I ever yet ſaw. The certainty of the ſum ought to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in which he and his Sureties ſhould have been bound; for otherwiſe the ſum required might be ſo great that any Perſon might be conſtrained to remain in Priſon. There may may be lawful inciting to the breach of the Law, as a Counſel or Attorney adviſing an Action which is not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſometimes it may be upon ſome particular deſign, as in <hi>Dier 168. Bronker</hi> being made Sheriff, one <hi>Hyde</hi> diſſuaded him from taking the Sheriffs Oath, becauſe of the difficulty of the Articles. <hi>B.</hi> was condemned in <hi>100 l</hi> fine and <hi>5</hi> weeks impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51792:251"/>
for refuſing of the Oath, and <hi>H.</hi> in <hi>20 l</hi> and <hi>5</hi> weeks impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for inciting him to it; and the reaſon was becauſe <hi>Hyde</hi> knew it to be an Offence, and that makes it differ from the caſe of a Counſel or Attorney; but the Offence was the leſs, becauſe the incitement was upon a particular reaſon, and not againſt the Law, <hi>quatenus</hi> a Law. In the Retorn here they don't ſay that they found he was guilty, but only that they found cauſe to ſuſpect him. Now what Remedy can be had in ſuch a Caſe, can an Iſſue be taken whether they had cauſe to ſuſpect him or no? Put the caſe, one who had been fined <hi>10 l</hi> for an Offence againſt this Act (in which caſe the Statute allows of an Appeal) had come to Mr. <hi>Rudyard</hi> to know what he ſhould do, and he had adviſed him to bring an Appeal at the Quarter Seſſions, this is no Offence and yet 'tis an abetting to ſuch as meet, and perhaps might be a cauſe of ſuſpition to a Iuſtice of Peace: I do not ſee that the Retorn is good in any part of it, and therefore he ought to be diſcharged; but I think the Iuſtices ſhould do well if they know him to be guilty, to commit him by a better Warrant; whereupon the Priſoner was diſcharged: For it is the uſage of this Court when the Iudges are of three Opinions, (as here my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Tyrrell</hi> for diſcharging him, <hi>Archer</hi> for putting him to Bail and <hi>Wyld</hi> for remanding him) to give the Rule according to the Opinion of the Two which agree.</p>
                     <p>The Court ſaid they had often directed, that no <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> ſhould be moved for in this Court except it concerned a Civil Cauſe, becauſe when the Party was brought in and the Cauſe ſhewn, this Court cannot proceed upon it, therefore the proper place to move for them is the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> but they permitted it in this Caſe, becauſe the Party was an Attorney of the Court.</p>
                     <p>The Court demanded of <hi>Rudyard</hi> upon his firſt bringing in, whether he would ſubmit to what they ſhould propoſe and direct, he ſaid <hi>he would ſubmit to the Rule of the Court;</hi> but the Court told him that he muſt do; but demanded whether he would yield to what they ſhould do by way of Arbitration; but he (tho' ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed otherwiſe by his own Counſel) diſcovered his unwillingneſs to ſubmit to any thing but the Rule of Law.</p>

And that there is a Cuſtom for the Citizens aſſembled in a Common Hall or Court, yearly to chooſe or continue thoſe Bridgemaſters. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cuſtom, that if one of theſe die within the Year, that the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſhall aſſemble a Common Hall, and they being Congregated, ſhall proceed to the election of another Bridgemaſter in his ſtead for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the year.

                     <p>It was objected alſo, <hi>That at the Common Law there was no Action for a Parliament man againſt a Sheriff for not returning of him being Elected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> That is a place of Burthen, this of Profit; if I have an Horſe or Beaſt-Market, and a Toll for Sale, and one hinder the Beaſts from coming hither, <hi>non conſtat</hi> whether they ſhould be ſold. Yet for the poſſibility of that, and of the loſs of the Toll thereon, an Action lies, <hi>41 E. 3. 24. Pl. 17. b.</hi> An <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Caſe</hi> was brought againſt a Sheriff for making of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to one to make a Retorn in the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Caſe, who indeed was not a Bailiff of a <hi>Franchiſe,</hi> and thereupon the Retorn was quaſhed, <hi>Br' tit' Act' Caſe, 120.</hi> So <hi>9 H. 6. 60.</hi> Action againſt an Eſcheator, who had taken an Office, whereby the Party was found to hold of <hi>J.S.</hi> and he retorned one whereby he was ſaid to hold the Moiety <hi>in Capite.</hi> Where an Officer does any thing againſt the Duty of his Place and Office, and a Damage thereby accrues to the Party, an Action lies: 'Tis poſitively affirmed here, he had the greater Number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archer</hi> of the ſame Opinion. This is a wilful dental of the duty of the Defendants Place, and for the particular Damage an Action lies. 'Twas ſaid there might be many Competitors, and all might bring Actions. No, for 'tis averred that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had the greateſt Number. An Action lies againſt an Arch-Deacon for not induct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>F. N. B. 94.</hi> So if a Sheriff will not execute a <hi>Writ of Seiſin,</hi> an Action lies againſt him. An Action lies againſt an Ordinary for admitting a wrong Patrons Clerk againſt a Verdict in a <hi>jure patronatus, Hob. 318.</hi> I agree to the Caſe put at the Bar, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Writ de Coronatore eligendo,</hi> if the Sheriff will not retorn him Coroner, who was choſen by the major part, an <hi>Action upon the Caſe</hi> lies, tho' I know no Authority for it in point, <hi>Vid. 6 E. 4. 9. b. Pl. 21.</hi> A man that has a Title to an Office, before he has poſſeſſion, ſhall have an <hi>Action upon the Caſe</hi> after an <hi>Aſſize, 21 E. 4. 23.</hi> is as memorable a Caſe for the purpoſe as any I know, there <hi>Fairfax</hi> gives good advice to Pleaders to mind <hi>Actions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caſe;</hi> and then he ſaid the uſe of the <hi>Subpoena</hi> would not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51792:252"/>
be ſo frequent, <hi>Hob. 205.</hi> Action for ſuing double Execution. I think <hi>Actions upon the Caſe</hi> ſhould be according to <hi>Juſtice Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax's his advice favoured in Courts of Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tyrrell.</hi> Perhaps there never was ſuch an Action, which is an Argument againſt it, <hi>Litt. 107.</hi> but I think it lies. Action lies not againſt a Lord for not admitting a Copy-holder, nor againſt Feoffees in truſt for refuſing to make a Feofment, or a Tenant for refuſing to Attorn, or againſt a Foeffor for refuſing to make Livery according to the Charter; but it lies againſt an Officer or againſt a Clerk for refuſing to enroll: This Action is for Damages for being prevented of having the Office, and not for the Office it ſelf. The Caſes of the Copy-holders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this, for there are proper Remedies for them, as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poena's,</hi> and other Writs at the Common Law, but here is none. <hi>De cetero non recedunt Partes a Curia noſtra ſine Remedio, ne Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria deficeret in Juſtitia exhibenda</hi> ſays the Statute. And my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> ſays 'tis a Maxim in Law, that no Action lies for the Ward againſt the Lord which diſparages him, but the next of Kin may enter. <hi>Co. Lit. 107.</hi> An Action lies as much for injurious preventing him of having the Office, as for hindring in of him the executing of it after that he is in. For <hi>Actions of the Caſe</hi> are not of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Form, but vary according to the Circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>It was objected, <hi>That every Action upon the Caſe ſuppoſes <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens &amp; injuriam;</hi> now here was no Election, 'tis impoſſible to know whether he ſhould be an Officer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Cuſtom is alledged poſitive, that he which hath the greater Number is elected <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> again, <hi>qui deſtruit medium deſtruit finem,</hi> 'tis as bad as if he had turned him out of his Office: It may be tried whether he were duly elected, and 'tis in effect tried here; there cannot be multiplicity of Actions brought, by this this Mayor will make himſelf ſole Iudge and Arbiter, and diſpoſe of Elections which ſhould be Popular and as my Brother hath ſaid, an <hi>Action of the Caſe</hi> lies for a poſſibility of Damage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vaughan, Chief Juſtice, contra.</hi> That wherein I am ſatisfied is, that no Damage appears; ſuppoſe none had been elected, he ſhould not have an Action more than any perſon in the Town: If a Mayor will not elect a Burgeſs, or a Sheriff a Knight, no <hi>Action</hi> lies, becauſe there is no Election. If an Officer will not elect at all, 'tis againſt his Duty, and ſo 'tis if he do it unduly; but he is puniſhable in a publick way by Information, or it may be by Indictment: If <hi>20</hi> had ſtood, muſt each have recovered the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Place?</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But there is an Averment that he was choſen by the greater Number.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51792:253"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That can't be put in Iſſue, or known or tried; ſuppoſe the Election were by Ballots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould he have an Action for not opening the Box. In the Caſe of the Coroner there is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Damage, and 'tis againſt the Statute; and in the Caſe of Induction there is a certain loſs. I take it that 'tis not Actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to call a man Baſtard, while his Father is alive, the Books are croſs in it: nay, if Land had Diſcended, I doubt it without a Special Damage, no more than to ſay one had no Title to his Land. The Caſe of the Market is cloſe, but there the Perſon damnified is certain, and the thing leads to deprive him of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Kings Grant. But my Brothers have given the Rule, take Iudgment.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It was moved in <hi>Court,</hi> that this <hi>Fine</hi> might be ſet aſide and a <hi>Fine</hi> impoſed upon the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> for the undue <hi>Practice</hi> and taking of a <hi>Fine</hi> of one under Age.

                     <p>IN an <hi>Ejectment,</hi> upon a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> the Caſe was to this effect:</p>
                     <p>It was found that there was a <hi>Pariſh</hi> of <hi>Ribton</hi> and <hi>Vill</hi> of <hi>Ribton;</hi> but not Coextenſive with the <hi>Pariſh.

                        <hi>Serjeant Maynard</hi> Argued, that it would not; and ſaid, that the <hi>Diviſion</hi> by <hi>Pariſhes</hi> is wholly <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> the Limits of which are equal to the Cure of the <hi>Parſon:</hi> But that of <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Vills</hi> is <hi>Civil,</hi> and hath the ſame Limits with the Power of the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and <hi>Tythingman.</hi> Where a Place is named in a <hi>Record</hi> of the Law, and no more ſaid, 'tis always intended a <hi>Vill;</hi> tho' when a <hi>Vill</hi> and <hi>Pariſh</hi> are both mentioned, and of the ſame <hi>Name,</hi> they are intended <hi>Coextenſive.</hi> The later <hi>Authorities</hi> have admitted <hi>Fines</hi> to be levied of <hi>Land</hi> in a place known, <hi>1 Cro. 2 Ro. 20.</hi> But in a <hi>Recovery</hi> the <hi>Town</hi> muſt be mentioned.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis Objected, <hi>That here the Intention appears by the Deed, that theſe Lands ſhould paſs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But he Anſwered, That cannot carry the Words further than they are contained in the <hi>Record.</hi>
                     </p>

In <hi>1659.</hi> the Mannor was aliened to the <hi>Lord Conwallis,</hi> then came the <hi>Act of Attainder 12 Car. 2.</hi> whereby <hi>Tychburn</hi> with other Regicides were attainted, and thereby it was Enacted, <hi>That all their Mannors, Meſſuages, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Reverſions, Remainders, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, Rights, Conditions, Intereſts, Offices, Annuities, and all other Hereditaments, Leaſes for Years, Chattels Real, and other things of that nature whatſoever they be, ſhall ſtand forfeited to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Provided that no Conveyance, Aſſurance, Grant, Bargain, Sale, Charge, Leaſe, Aſſignment of Leaſe, Grants and Surrenders by Copy of Court Roll, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made to any Perſon or Perſons, other than the Wife or Wives, Child or Children, Heir or Heirs of ſuch Perſon or Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi> After which Attainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Lord of the Mannor</hi> cauſed the Lands to be ſeiſed, and brought an <hi>Ejectment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt Point,</hi> Was whether in Caſe of Treaſon or Felony the Lord can ſeiſe before Conviction or Attainder? And the Court ſeemed to be of Opinion, that no Seiſure could be till Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without Special Cuſtom; but they agreed the preſentment of the Homage was not neceſſary to precede a Seiſure, or to entitle the Lord to take the advantage of a Forfeiture; but in caſe of a Capital Crime it would be unreaſonable and inconvenient to permit the ſame to be tried or controverted in a Civil Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conviction appeared upon Record.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether this were ſuch a Forfeiture as the Lord was bound to take notice thereof; for if no notice, then the acceptance of the Surrender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would not preclude him from taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Forfeiture. And the Court inclined that the Lord ſhould be preſumed to take notice in this Caſe, as he ſhall in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51792:258"/>
the Caſe of Failer of Suit of Court, Non-paiment of Rent, <hi>&amp;c. Vide 2 Cro. Matthews and Whetton 233.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether the Mannor being conveyed away before the Attainder ſhall purge the Forfeiture.</p>
                     <p>Iuſtice <hi>Levins</hi> ſaid, That although no advantage of this Forfeiture can be taken till Attainder, yet after Attainder it has relation, and the committing of Treaſon is the Forfeiture: There is a difference between an Heir taking advantage of a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the time of the Anceſtor; and an Alienee in the time of the former Lord, <hi>Vid. Owen 63.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then Iuſtice <hi>Charleton</hi> declared his Opinion that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyhold was given to the King, by the of Statute of <hi>12 Car.</hi> For the generality of the words, <hi>other things of that Nature whatſoever,</hi> and that enforced by the Proviſo, <hi>where meſn Conveyances, Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by Copy</hi> were mentioned.</p>
                     <p>But the other Iuſtices ſeemed to be of another Opinion, for that Copyholds were never included in a Statute where any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice would thereby accrue to the Lord, unleſs expreſly named; and for the Proviſo, it might be ſatisfied by the Copyholds, which the Traitors might hold of the Kings Mannors, or where they had a Mannor held of the King, and had made voluntary Grants of Copyholds, and Surrenders made ſubſequent: And ſo 'twas ſaid to be the Opinion of my Lord <hi>Hales, 16 Car. 2.</hi> when he was Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> But however they were ordered to attend the Kings Attorney General, to know whether he deſired to be heard to that point. <hi>Et adjornatur.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A</hi> Motion had been made for a Prohibition, upon a Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>per legem terrae</hi> no man ought to be Iudge in his own Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor ought any man to be compelled to anſwer Articles proſecuted againſt him <hi>ex mero Officio, &amp;c.</hi> And that contrary hereto the <hi>Defendant</hi> had articled againſt the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,</hi> that he did out of his own private Will and Spirit, and contrary to the Laws, keep <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and did allow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one <hi>South</hi> and others, pretended Miniſters, and not allowed by the Church, to Expound and Preach to himſelf and many others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was <hi>ex promotione <hi>A. B.</hi> Notarij Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was not alledged in this Libel or Articles, that there was any Preſentment of this Matter, but the Regiſter of the Court ſwore that there was a Preſentment made by the Curate of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that a certain Copy which he delivered here into Court was a true Copy thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ellis</hi> Serjeant for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, Conventicles</hi> are properly puniſhable at the Common Law, and not by the Eccleſiaſtical Law, they are inquirable upon every Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer and Terminer, 4 Inſt 162.</hi> and the late <hi>Act againſt Conventicles</hi> was in force at this time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> No man ought to be proceeded againſt in the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> without a due preſentment. <hi>25 H. 8. c. 14.</hi> declares that 'tis not reaſonable that any Ordinary by any ſuſpition conceived of his own fancy, without due accuſation or preſentment, ſhould put any Subject of this Realm into the infamy or ſlander of Hereſie And the reaſon of this extends to other things as well as Hereſie. Indeed this Statute is repealed, but as my <hi>Lord Coke 12 Rep. 26.</hi> obſerves it was herein declaratory of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law; and 'tis great reaſon that there ſhould be a preſentment and accuſation by ſome proper Perſon, for otherwiſe an innocent Perſon in caſe of falſe accuſation would not known where to have his remedy.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Here is a Preſentment by the Curate, and by the 113 of the Canons made 3 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> a Curate in the abſence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor may preſent.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:51792:260"/>
                        <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> Theſe Canons were never confirmed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and without that there cannot be any Canons made to alter the Law, <hi>12 Co. 72, 73.</hi> at leaſt they can bind none but the Clergy, <hi>Vid. Mo. 755.</hi> and one reaſon thereof is, becauſe the Laity have no Repreſentatives in the Convocation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Canon ſays only, <hi>that a Curate may preſent in the abſence of the Rector;</hi> it doth not appear here that the Rector was abſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All ſuch Preſentments ought to be upon Oath, and this is not proved ſo to be: The Courts in this Hall cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon any ſuch thing without Oath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is not alledged in the Libel or Articles, that there was any Preſentment at all, only the Regiſter comes in and ſaith <hi>he finds ſuch a Preſentment among the Acts of the Court,</hi> ſo that Iſſue cannot be taken whether any or no: So it muſt be taken his proceeding was <hi>ex Officio mero</hi> without Preſentment, and 'tis as great a miſchief as was by reaſon of common Informers before the <hi>18 Eliz. c. 5.</hi> appointed their names to be endorſed upon all Proceſs ſued out by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In this Caſe they will examine upon Oath: Now no Layman ought to anſwer upon Oath except in Caſes matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and Teſtamentary, <hi>12 Co. 26, 27. 3 Cro. 262.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Baldwyn contra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Conventicles</hi> are puniſhable at the Common Law, or were by the late Statute, does not diſprove or take away the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> for the proceedings are <hi>diverſo reſpectu.</hi> We proceed againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> as being againſt the Peace, and as being againſt the Laws of the Church, and to prevent the broaching of Heterodor Opinions, as in one Court we do <hi>agere civiliter</hi> by Action, <hi>&amp; criminaliter</hi> by Information for the ſame matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The proceeding in this Caſe is according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of proceeding in their Court; for when a Preſentment is made, they form Articles thereupon, <hi>tibi articulamur &amp; objici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. &amp;c.</hi> but they never recite or mention the Preſentment in the Articles, and therefore it does not, nor need it appear in them in this Caſe. So that it cannot from hence he concluded to be a proſecution <hi>ex Officio mero.</hi> Moreover <hi>25 H. 8.</hi> when it was in force concerned Hereſie only.</p>
                     <p>As to the Preſentment made in this Caſe by the Curate.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Thoſe Canons are not to be queſtioned, they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways allowed, having been confirmed by the King.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> The Rectors abſence ſhall be intended.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> The Churchwardens themſelves, whoſe ancient and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned Office it is to make Preſentments, don't take a particular Oath upon all the Preſentments they make, but they do it by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51792:260"/>
vertue of their general Oath of Churchwardens, and Miniſters do the ſame (as the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> preſent in Court had aſſerted juſt before <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis,)</hi> or rather by vertue of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oath of Canonical Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>4.</hi> They are not bound to ſpecifie the Preſentment in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and this is not ſo liable to the Objection of Miſchief and Vnreaſonableneſs, as the Informations daily brought in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in the Name of the Clerk of the Crown; which Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are approved and preſerved by the very Statute of <hi>18 Eliz. c. 5.</hi> And if there be no due Preſentment, 'tis an Error which conſiſts in not proceeding according to their Rules, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Canon Law, and the proper remedy for that is by Appeal; and our Courts will not take notice whether they obſerve their own Laws. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions are only to be granted when the Common Law is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and interfered with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the examining of the Party upon Oath, here is no cauſe to mention it; and indeed it is not their courſe, for they only ask him <hi>ore tenus,</hi> whether he will confeſs or deny the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; if he deny them, then there is <hi>litis conteſtatio,</hi> and they proceed to examine Witneſſes to prove it; and if it be not proved, the Informer is condemned in Coſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Juſtice Wyld.</hi> I am of Opinion that there ſhould go no Prohibition. We muſt Iudge only upon the Suggeſtion: Here 'tis ſuggeſted that the <hi>Defendant</hi> proceeded againſt the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ex Officio,</hi> but that may be underſtood two ways, either that he proceeded <hi>officioſe</hi> on his own head, or that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of Duty according to his Duty, and nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the contrary of this laſt, and then he did as he ought. If the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had ſuggeſted that by the Law of the Land there ought to be a Preſentment by ſuch perſons in ſuch manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he might have brought that into queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archer of the ſame Opinion.</hi> We muſt give faith and credit to their proceedings, and preſume that they are according to their Law, <hi>4 Co. 29</hi> The King with the Convocation may make Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Conſtitutions for the Government of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tyrrell of the ſame Opinion.</hi> But if the Suggeſtion were that no Preſentment by a Curate were ſufficient, nor unleſs it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhould have been Opinion for a Prohibition. I hold that the King and Convocation, without the Parliament, can't make any Canons which ſhall bind the Laity though they may the Clergy, <hi>Vid. 35 H. 8. c. 19.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vaughan of the ſame Opinion.</hi> If the Articles were exhibited meerly <hi>ex Officio, i.e.</hi> out of the mind of the Chancellor himſelf they were not warrantable. But there is no colour for this Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, for they appear to be the Information of a Publick Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As to the Preſentment which is thought requiſite by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51792:261"/>
of <hi>25 H. 8. c. 14.</hi> declaratory of the Common Law or not, it is ſufficient Anſwer to ſay that <hi>the Act is repealed and therein the Preamble:</hi> And for ought any man knows, the Preamble was the Cauſe of the Repeal; this has been the only ſpecious Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As to the Canons <hi>3 Jacobi</hi> certainly they are of force, tho' never confirmed by Act of Parliament. Indeed no Canons of <hi>England</hi> ſtand confirmed by Act of Parliament; yet they are the Laws which bind and govern in Eccleſiaſtick Affairs. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation with the Licenſe and aſſent of the King under the Great Seal may make Canons for regulation of the Church, and that as well concerning Laicks as Eccleſiaſticks; and ſo is <hi>Linwood.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they cannot alter or infringe the Common Law, Statute Law or Kings Prerogative, but they may make alterations (<hi>viz.</hi> in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Matters) or elſe they could make no new Canons: All that is required of them in making of new Canons is, that they confine themſelves to Church Matters. As no Human Law can be made which is contrary to the Divine Law; and it is binding only in thoſe things which are <hi>permiſſa</hi> by the Divine Law: So no Canon Law can be made which is repugnant to the Law of the Land. The Subject Matter is in the Caſe. The <hi>permiſſa,</hi> the things of Eccleſiaſtical Nature, which are left indifferent by the Law of the Land; in this Caſe we muſt preſume there was a Preſentment according to their Law, if not the Remedy is by Appeal. We ought not to aſſume the Iuriſdiction of Iudging upon their Law, but give way to their courſe of Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Serjeant Ellis.</hi> I only intended that Canons cannot be made to alter the Law without Parliament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Curia.</hi> We all agree as to the Firſt Exception, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Court may proceed againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> as a Spiritual Offence, tho' not as a Civil.</p>
                     <p>As to the Second, That they have Conuſans of all Falſe Worſhippers.</p>
                     <p>As to the Third, That there is nocolour or occaſion to make it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> The Courſe of the Spiritual Court is not to make a <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificavit</hi> until forty days after the Excommunication. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Citation is a cauſe of Prohibition, for it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for what Cauſe: But this is cured by Appearance or Appeal.</p>

                     <p>To this it was Anſwered, That there was nothing appeared in the Pleading of a <hi>Common Inn,</hi> and ſo the Matter did not come in queſtion; neither was it ſet forth that the <hi>Cattle</hi> were driving to Market, but only to <hi>London, ad proficuum inde faciend'.</hi> And beſides, in the Barr to the <hi>Avowry</hi> the <hi>Licenſe</hi> is the only Matter relyed upon, which doth not Conclude the <hi>Leſſor</hi> from taking the <hi>Diſtreſs.</hi> And of that <hi>Opinion</hi> was the <hi>Court.</hi>

                     <p>Then they find that he had made no ſettlement of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, or of any part of them, upon his Wife; and that the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Plaintiff was Heir at Law to <hi>Chriſtopher Hewly,</hi> and that <hi>Ann</hi> the Wife is ſtill living: So that the ſole Queſtion was,

                     <p>Again, This Deviſe is introduced with this Clauſe, <hi>as to the diſpoſing of my Perſonal Eſtate;</hi> and throughout the <hi>Will</hi> he giveth only Perſonal Things.</p>

                     <p>IN an Action of <hi>Covenant</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> declared upon certain Articles of Agreement made between the ſaid <hi>Williams</hi> (for and on behalf of <hi>Thomas Manning</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Gent.) of the one part, and the ſaid <hi>Raſhley</hi> of the other part; whereby it appeared that it was agreed between the Parties, that the ſaid <hi>Raſhley quiorè &amp; pacificè haberet, teneret, occuparet, poſſideret &amp; gauderet Tenement' vocat' <hi>Le Saltmarſh &amp;c.</hi>
                        </hi> for the term of one year, Except <hi>è dimiſſione praedict' cuidam <hi>Edwardo Knollis</hi> nuper tenent' prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſorum unum parvum clauſum parcell' praemiſſ.</hi> And it was further agreed, that the ſaid <hi>Raſhly</hi> ſhould pay <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> by <hi>Quarterly payments</hi> for the ſaid year.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſeis forth, that he entred into the Premiſſes and put in his <hi>Cattle,</hi> and that before the year was out the ſaid <hi>Edward Knollis</hi> ſued the ſaid <hi>Raſhly</hi> in an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> for entring into the Premiſſes, and putting in of his <hi>Cattle, &amp;c.</hi> and in that Action he recovered <hi>Twenty pounds Damages</hi> againſt him, and <hi>Seventeen pounds Coſts,</hi> which he was forced to pay, and was put to the Expence of <hi>Twelve pounds</hi> more in defence of the Suit, and ſo he did not hold the Premiſſes quietly, but was ſued and diſturbed, and compelled to pay as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded, that he did not break his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And upon that <hi>Iſſue</hi> was joyned, and found for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was moved in <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> that it did not appear that <hi>Knollis</hi> ſued upon any <hi>Title,</hi> which ſhould have been ſet forth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:51792:270"/>
                        <hi>Levins</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> Argued, That it was not neceſſary to ſet forth the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Knollis,</hi> becauſe this was a <hi>Covenant</hi> for the quiet enjoyment of the poſſeſſion; and for that cited <hi>Dyer 128.</hi> where the <hi>Covenant</hi> was, That he ſhould enjoy <hi>abſque interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione alicujus;</hi> and ſo is <hi>1 Roll Abr. 430.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, This is a <hi>Collateral Agreement</hi> by a <hi>Stranger</hi> to the Land, and no <hi>Leaſe.</hi> 'Tis no more than a <hi>Covenant</hi> by a <hi>Stranger,</hi> that he ſhall quietly enjoy the Land, and that ſhall be conſtrued ſtrongeſt againſt him to extend to any diſturbance whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>And he urged further, that this Diſturbance was by <hi>Edward Knollis,</hi> and he was mentioned in the Articles; and ſo it ſeems a <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt a particular perſon, and that goes to any diſturbance,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 512.</note> whether upon <hi>Title</hi> or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>But it was Reſolved by <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Ventris,</hi> (the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> being abſent, and <hi>Rokeby</hi> doubting) that the <hi>Declaration</hi> was inſufficient, in regard it was not ſet forth that <hi>Knollis</hi> had any Right; for the Articles did amount to a <hi>Leaſe,</hi> tho' by a <hi>Stranger,</hi> for he acted in behalf of the Owner of the Land, and it ſhall be taken he had an Authority to demiſe, and it appears they intended it a <hi>Demiſe;</hi> for that part excepted is mentioned to be <hi>è dimiſſione praedict':</hi> But if it were a <hi>Collateral Covenant</hi> by a <hi>Stranger,</hi> it would be hard to extend it to a <hi>Tortious Entry.</hi> A <hi>Collateral Warranty</hi> given by a <hi>Stranger,</hi> extends only to <hi>Titles</hi> prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p>In the Caſe of <hi>Wotton and Hele</hi> in the <hi>2 Sand. 177.</hi> it was ſet forth, that <hi>J. S.</hi> entred <hi>Habens legale Titulum;</hi> and that was held naught after a <hi>Verdict,</hi> becauſe not expreſly ſet forth to be an ancient <hi>Right.</hi> The Caſe cited in <hi>Dyer</hi> ſeems to go upon the words, <hi>Abſque interruptione alicujus.</hi> See for that <hi>Hob.</hi> in <hi>Teſdale and Eſſex's Caſe,</hi> and as 'tis cited by <hi>Rolls Abr.</hi> the <hi>1ſt part 430.</hi> and <hi>Vaughan 118. Hayes and Bickerſtaff. Vid. 3. Cro. 373, 436. Cro. Jac. 425.</hi> where the <hi>Promiſe</hi> was to enjoy without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of any perſon, and yet held that a <hi>Title</hi> ought to be ſet forth. This is no <hi>Covenant</hi> expreſs againſt <hi>Knollis,</hi> for he is only mentioned for the part excepted, and to have been <hi>Tenant</hi> of the Premiſſes; and ſo in the principal Caſe <hi>Judgment</hi> was ſtayed.</p>

                     <p>This Caſe was ſpoken to the laſt Term, and then <hi>Pollexfen Chief Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Rokeby</hi> were of Opinion for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and <hi>Powell</hi> and <hi>Ventris</hi> for the <hi>Defendant;</hi> and it was again argued at the Bar this Term, and by the Opinion of the <hi>Chief Juſtice Powell</hi> and <hi>Rokeby,</hi> Iudgment was given for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Rokeby</hi> held the Plea to be naught, chiefly becauſe the <hi>Defendant</hi> pleads that he detained the Chattel till the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had paid ſo much Mony to the uſe of the Sheriff; whereas it ſhould have been to the uſe of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> at whoſe ſuit the Execution was.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, that he found no Authority in Law that warranted the delivering of the Goods back to the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon payment of part of the Mony, <hi>vide 1 Cro. 404. Strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>verſus</hi> Stanlack,</hi> but here the taking of the Mony to the uſe of the Sheriff made him a Treſpaſſer, for it could not be done in purſuance of the Execution.

He alſo ſaid, that if this manner of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be allowed, admitting that the Bayliff had agreed to take the Mony to the Sheriffs proper uſe, how ſhould the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> be let in to a Replication in this manner of Pleading to put the matter in iſſue?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rokeby</hi> ſaid, <hi>Parols font Plea,</hi> and that it muſt be here taken that the Mony was paid to the proper uſe of the Sheriff; and in pleading the matter is to be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt him that pleads.</p>

                        <hi>Note,</hi> The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> cited the Caſe of <hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Clarke, 1 Cro. 504.</hi> where 'tis ſaid, that the Sheriff cannot deliver the <hi>Defendants</hi> Goods to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in ſatisfaction of the Debt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought they to be delivered to the <hi>Defendant</hi> againſt whom the Execution is, but they ought to be ſold, and the appriſement is not material for the Goods upon a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> need not to be appraiſed as they muſt be upon <hi>Elegit, 1 Cro. 584.</hi> in <hi>Palmers</hi> Caſe. In the Caſe of <hi>Goodyers</hi> and <hi>Ince, 2 Cro. 246.</hi> upon an <hi>Elegit</hi> it was held, that the Sheriff could not ſell a Term to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> himſelf that took out the <hi>Elegit.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Powell</hi> was of Opinion, that the Plea was good in that point of paying the Mony to the uſe of the Sheriff, for he hath an intereſt or ſpecial property in the thing taken in Execution, <hi>1 Cro. 639.</hi> the Sheriff may bring treſpaſs againſt one that takes Goods after they are ſeiſed in Execution, <hi>Wilbraham</hi> and <hi>Snow, 2 Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders 47.</hi> reſolved that in ſuch Caſe the Sheriff may bring Trover.</p>
                     <p>But he held the Plea inſufficient for the other exception, becauſe the Declaration is of a Detainer till the Mony was paid to <hi>Francis</hi> and the <hi>Defendant;</hi> And in the Plea the Iuſtification is of the detaining till the Mony was paid to <hi>Francis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He took another Exception alſo, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had not ſhewn that there was a retorn made of the Warrant to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, and cited <hi>Br' Tit. Treſpaſs 566.</hi> but that was not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, becauſe the Warrant was not directed to the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> here, but to <hi>Francis</hi> and another, and the <hi>Defendant</hi> ought not to be puniſhed for the omiſſion of the Bayliffs in not retorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Warrant. Vpon a <hi>Meſn Proces</hi> the Bayliff who acts by a Warrant from the Sheriffs, is not liable in Treſpaſs if the Sheriff does not retorn the Writ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ventris</hi> was of Opinion for the <hi>Defendant</hi> as to the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the payment to the uſe of the Sheriff he thought ought to be taken upon the whole matter ſet forth in the Plea, that it was paid to the particular and ſpecial uſe of the Sheriff, <hi>viz.</hi> that he might have the Mony in Court as the Writ commands, and the Warrant mentions, and it was a ſtrained conſtruction to take it to be to the proper uſe of the Sheriff; it would not have been proper to ſay, paid to the Bayliff to the uſe of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> becauſe 'tis not the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Mony till 'tis paid to him, in the Caſe of <hi>Benſon</hi> and <hi>Flower, 3 Cro.</hi> and <hi>Jones 115.</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> became Bankrupt, the Commiſſioners could not aſſign the Mony that had been levied at the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> ſuit upon Execution, or remaining in the Sheriffs Hands or in Court; a Barr is good to a common intent.</p>

                     <p>Again, If this payment muſt be taken to be to the proper uſe of the Sheriff, and ſo not in purſuance to the Execution, yet he held that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> here could not maintain an <hi>Action of Treſpaſs,</hi> that in regard that he is <hi>particeps criminis,</hi> the detaining the Goods is but a <hi>Nonfeaſans.</hi> If the Sheriff upon <hi>Meſn Proceſs</hi> refuſes Bayl, this does does not make him a Treſpaſſer <hi>ab initio,</hi> tho' he is liable to an <hi>Action upon the Caſe</hi> for ſuch refuſal; and ſo is the Caſe of <hi>Salmon</hi> and <hi>Percival, Jones 226.</hi> and <hi>1 Cro.</hi> So alſo if the Sheriff detains a man taken upon <hi>Meſn Proceſs</hi> after a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas,</hi> and that appears by <hi>Stringer</hi> and <hi>Stanlacks</hi> Caſe, <hi>1 Cro. 404.</hi> and <hi>Withers</hi> and <hi>Henly's</hi> Caſe, <hi>2 Cro. 379.</hi> there ſaid the detaining is a new Caption; but it is objected here, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Mony is a <hi>Misfeaſans;</hi> and in <hi>6 Co. Poulters</hi> Caſe, if a man diſtrain and abuſeth the Diſtreſs, he is a Treſpaſſer <hi>ab initio;</hi> ſo where a thing is done by an authority of Law, and an abuſe is committed after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is true, if there were a <hi>Misfeaſans</hi> in any matter wherein the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in this Action had not concurred: If a man ſhould detain a Horſe, and the Owner ſhould bid him ride him, would this make him a Treſpaſſor <hi>ab initio,</hi> as if he had rode him without ſuch licence? The payment is here the Act of the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> in this Action, and therefore he was of Opinion, that he could not bring Treſpaſs. But by the Opinion of the other Three Iudges, <hi>Judgment was given pro Quer'.</hi>

Eſpecially this Plea is not to be admitted ſince the Statute of <hi>16 &amp; 17 Car. 2. c. 5.</hi> which was made to prevent delay of Execution upon <hi>Judgments, Statutes</hi> and <hi>Recognizances;</hi> and Enacts, that when any <hi>Judgment, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be extended, the ſame ſhall not be delayed or avoided by occaſion, that any part of the Lands and Tenements extendible, axe or ſhall be omitted out of ſuch <hi>Exten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> were of Opinion, that as to the Matter of the Plea, that it might be pleaded. And when one Tertenant is Returned ſummoned upon a <hi>Scire fac',</hi> he may plead that there are other Tertenants, tho' in another County; and this will put the Plaintiff to take out a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt them. <hi>Vid.</hi> for that the Lady <hi>Greſhams</hi> Caſe, <hi>Mo. 429.</hi> and <hi>Clarke and Hardwick</hi>'s Caſe <hi>Mo. 524.

                     <p>But the whole <hi>Court</hi> held, that ſuch Matter might be pleaded, and the Statute of <hi>22 &amp; 23 Car. 2.</hi> does not extend to this Caſe; for that is when an <hi>Extent</hi> is executed, and the Tertenant brings an <hi>Audita querela,</hi> he ſhall not drive the Plaintiff to extend anew, but the <hi>Extent</hi> ſhall ſtand, and he ſhall have Contribution againſt the reſt.</p>
                     <p>But the Pleading in this Caſe was altogether ill and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; for it is pleaded in Abatement of the Writ, which it ought not to be, but he ſhould have demanded Iudgment, <hi>ſi ipſe ad breve praed' in forma praed' retorn' reſpondere compelli debeat;</hi> and ſo is the Concluſion in <hi>Jefferſon</hi> and <hi>Dawſon</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>2 Sand. 23.</hi> and in <hi>Clarke</hi>'s Caſe <hi>in Mo. 524.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then he ſheweth, that the ſaid <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> were not ſummoned, <hi>nec in eodem brevi de Scire fac' nominat' nec in eodem retorno retornat',</hi> which is naught; for the Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk</hi> could not ſummon or return thoſe Tenants, being in another County.</p>
                     <p>But then it was ſhewn on the part of the Defendant, that the Record of the <hi>Scire fac'</hi> was wrong, for it was tituled <hi>Alias prout patet Term' Sancti Michaelis ultimo praeterito,</hi> and then ſets forth a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> Returnable <hi>tres ſeptiman' Trin. ultimo praeterito;</hi> who Returned, that there were no Tenants in <hi>Balliva ſua, &amp; ſuper hoc Teſtatum eſt in Cur' Regis hic,</hi> that there were ſeveral Tenants in the County of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> and upon that a <hi>Scire facias</hi> was awarded to the Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable <hi>tres Michael', &amp;c.</hi> So by this Record it would ſeem, the Writ and Return is all the ſame day, whereas the <hi>Teſtatum ſcire fac'</hi> ought to be in <hi>Trinity Term</hi> before; and therefore the Record ſhould have been tituled <hi>Alias prout patet Term' Sanctae Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat'.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this the <hi>Counſel</hi> for the Plaintiff prayed might be amended; but the <hi>Court</hi> would not permit it, unleſs they agreed to amend on both ſides.</p>

                           <hi>(Viz.)</hi> That if the above bound <hi>Katherine Becket,</hi> and <hi>James Millerd,</hi> ſhould yearly, during the Life of the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket</hi> and the minority of <hi>Mary Becket,</hi> pay unto the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket,</hi> or his Aſſigns, the ſum of Twelve pounds by equal payments, upon the 15th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and the 15th day of <hi>February,</hi> that then the Bond ſhould be void.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Defendant pleaded <hi>Actio non,</hi> for that upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> when the Bond was alledged to be made, and before the ſealing thereof, the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket</hi> (being Grandfather to <hi>Mary Becket</hi> in the <hi>Condition</hi> mentioned) who was then within Age, did deliver to the Defendant and the ſaid <hi>Katherine Becket, 200 l</hi> to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Mary,</hi> to be paid to her when ſhe ſhould be One and twenty years of Age. And it was then agreed, that the Defendant and the ſaid <hi>Katherine Becket</hi> ſhould give a Bond in <hi>200 l</hi> penalty to the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket:</hi> And it was alſo then agreed, that the <hi>Condition</hi> ſhould be for the payment of <hi>12 l</hi> yearly for the Intereſt thereof to the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> and his Aſſigns during the minority of the ſaid <hi>Mary, If the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſo long live,</hi> at the two days mentioned in the ſaid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> by equal portions; and if it ſhould happen that the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould dye before the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be One and twenty, that then the ſaid <hi>12 l</hi> Intereſt ſhould remain in the hands of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and the ſaid <hi>Katherine,</hi> for the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Mary,</hi> to be paid to her when ſhe ſhould come to <hi>21</hi> years of Age, and then to be paid to the ſaid <hi>Mary.</hi> And the Defendant further ſaith, that after the <hi>Bond</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> were ſo agreed, one <hi>Yeomans</hi> by miſtake wrote the <hi>Obligation</hi> as is in the Bond, upon which the Action is brought; and the ſaid Defendant and <hi>Katherine</hi> not knowing the Miſtake, ſealed the ſaid Bond <hi>prour;</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket</hi> afterwards died, and that only the firſt day of payment incurred between the date of the ſaid Bond and the death of <hi>Peter Becket, (viz.)</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> day of <hi>Auguſt, anno tertio Jacobi Regis.</hi> And the Defendant on the ſaid <hi>15th</hi> day, (Six pounds being all that was then due to the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket</hi>) at <hi>S. obtulit
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51792:293"/>
ſolvere,</hi> and was ever after ready to pay it to him; and after, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> the firſt day of <hi>December, anno tertio ſupradicto,</hi> did pay to the ſaid <hi>Peter Becket</hi> the ſaid Six pounds, which he did accept, <hi>unde petit Judicium, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Plaintiff replied <hi>Proteſtando,</hi> that there was no ſuch Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the ſaid <hi>Mary Becket</hi> was ſtill living and under Age, and that Six pounds became due upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February, anno quarto nuper Regis Jacobi,</hi> according to the ſaid Condition, which the Defendant had not paid, <hi>&amp; hoc paratus eſt verificare, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this the Defendant demurred, and it was inſiſted on for the Defendant that this Agreement might be pleaded, and averred to ſhew the meaning of the parties, and to have the Condition taken accordingly. As the Caſe of <hi>Neviſon</hi> and <hi>Whitly</hi> in the <hi>3 Cro.</hi> and in <hi>Jones Rep. 396.</hi> where the Condition of the Bond was for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Intereſt at Six months, as much as the Statute allows for a year, and it was ſhewn to be made ſo by the Miſtake of the Scrivener, and that the Agreement of the parties was for no more than juſt Intereſt; and this was held a good Averment to ſave the Bond from being void by the Statute of <hi>Uſury.</hi> And a Caſe between <hi>Lewknor and Mountague</hi> was cited, where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Bond was, <hi>If <hi>William Mountague</hi> ſhall do, &amp;c.</hi> whereas there was <hi>William Mountague</hi> the Father and <hi>William Mountague</hi> the Son, and by the Averment of the meaning of the parties this was expounded of the Son.</p>
                     <p>But the whole <hi>Court</hi> were here of Opinion, that the <hi>Averment</hi> in the Caſe at Bar was not to be admitted; for it would carry the Condition to another ſenſe then the words import.</p>
                     <p>As to the Caſe upon the Statute of <hi>Uſury,</hi> there it depends upon the Agreement; and the party may ſhew any to make appear there was no Corrupt Agreement. <hi>Vid ante, hoc Termino</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Buſh and Buckingham.</hi> And as to <hi>Lewknor</hi>'s Caſe, the <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was but to aſcertain which <hi>William Mountague</hi> was meant, and ſtands well with the words of the Condition. But whether, as the Condition is penned, for the payment to be during the Life of <hi>Peter Becket</hi> and the Minority of <hi>Mary,</hi> that the payment ſhould determine upon the death of <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> did not deliver their Opinion (according to the Opinion in <hi>Brudnell</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>5 Co. 9.</hi> it would ſeem that it ſhould. But the Caſe of <hi>Croſs and Tooker</hi> in <hi>Latch. 162.</hi> ſeems ſtrong to the contrary. <hi>Vid.</hi> that Caſe in <hi>Popham 201.</hi> and in <hi>1 Anderſon 151. abſque impetitione vaſti</hi> during their Lives, held, that the Priviledge ſhall continue to the Survivor.)</p>

                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:51792:293"/>But the whole Court held the pleading of the tender inſufficient, becauſe it is not ſaid that <hi>Peter Becket</hi> refuſed; otherwiſe if a place of payment had been in the condition, and it had been ſhewn in pleading, that the party which was to receive the Mony, was not there, <hi>1 Cro. 888.</hi> Plea of tender without ſetting forth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, not good, <hi>Lea</hi> and <hi>Exellies</hi> Caſe: And the acceptance after the day ſignifies nothing, and upon that point the Court were of Opinion for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> but Iudgment was not given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the parties ſhewed an inclination to compoſe the buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> replies, <hi>quod bene &amp; verum eſt,</hi> that the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators made no Award, and that before the <hi>16th</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> aforeſaid, <hi>Scilicet,</hi> at the day and place in the Plea of the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> mentioned, they did name the ſaid <hi>Francis Jeſſup</hi> to be Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire between the ſaid Parties; but he further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Frincis Jeſſup adtunc &amp; ibidem for Umpiratorem penitus recuſavit, &amp; ſuperinde,</hi> the ſaid Arbitrators <hi>poſtea adtunc &amp; ibidem nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt quendam Cornelium Clarke Armig'</hi> to be Vmpire between the ſaid Parties; and further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Clarke poſtea &amp; ante praedict' decimum ſextum diem Aprilis, ſcilicet, apud London, &amp;c. ſuſcepto ſuper ſe onere Umpiragii praedict' ore tenus arbitravit &amp; ordinavit quod praedict' Johannes Eyre ſolveret praedict' Burrows Trippett ſeptuaginta libras, &amp;c.</hi> And that after payment the Parties ſhould give mutual Releaſes, and ſaith that the Defendant did not pay the ſaid <hi>70 l</hi> according to the ſaid award, <hi>&amp; hoc paratus eſt verificare, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Replication the <hi>Defendant</hi> demurred. This Caſe was the laſt Term argued at the Bar, and the Court took time till this Term to give their Opinions.</p>
                     <p>The ſole Queſtion was, whether the award made by <hi>Clarke</hi> was good, in regard the Arbitrators had before named <hi>Jeſſup</hi> to be Vmpire, and tho' he refuſed, it was inſiſted on for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> that the Arbitrators were concluded to name another, and ſo <hi>Cornelius Clarke</hi> had no Authority as Vmpire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Powell, Rokeby</hi> and <hi>Ventris</hi> were of Opinion for the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſons the three Iuſtices went upon were, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Jeſſup</hi> to be Vmpire did not make him Vmpire, and that his refuſal immediately upon his nomination made it amount <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o no more than a bare propoſal to him, and ſo to ſtand for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and then it did not conclude the Arbitrators, but that they might name another: The penning of the Condition of the Bond is to be obſerved, the words being, <hi>to ſtand to the Award of ſuch Umpire as the Arbitrators ſhould nominate, and not of ſuch Perſon as they ſhould name to be Umpire.</hi> So that there is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a deſcription or qualification of the Perſon to whoſe award the Parties ſhould ſubmit, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch an one as ſhould be Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Vmpire by the nomination of the Arbitrators. Now <hi>Jeſſup,</hi> tho' nominated, yet was not Vmpire, for his refuſal hindred that, and therefore doth not come within the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Pleading is always <hi>ſuſcepto ſuper ſe onere Arbitrii,</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:51792:296"/>
ſo that 'tis the acceptance that makes him Vmpire or Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator,</p>
                     <p>But it is objected, that the Arbitrators here have executed their Authority, and tis done as fully as can be on their parts, and therefore they have no power to name any other; The Condition empowered them to name one, but not to name a ſecond.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, when an Authority is once fully executed, the Power is determined; but here, admitting it to be an Authority, (which <hi>Ventris</hi> ſaid it was not properly to be called ſo, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no expreſs Authority given to the Arbitrators, but 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deſcription or qualification of the Perſon which is to make the Award <hi>ut ſupra</hi>) yet there is no compleat execution. If a Letter of Attorney be to deliver <hi>Seiſin,</hi> and the Attorney deliver <hi>Seiſin</hi> within the view, which is no good Execution of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet ſure that does not hinder him from delivering <hi>Seiſin</hi> upon the Land; an <hi>habere fac' proceſs</hi> was executed by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff in delivering a Houſe, and after it was over, it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that a Perſon was hid in a Room of the Houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was turned out, and the Sheriff delivered Execution again, which was reſolved to be well in <hi>Palmers Rep. 289.</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to Awards have been favourably conſtrued, becauſe they tend to the end of Controverſies; it was ſurely the Parties meaning, if the Arbitrators named a man that rejected the Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage, that this ſhould not conclude them from naming another: This nomination can be taken to be no more than a propoſal of the thing to <hi>Jeſſup,</hi> who muſt be taken to be preſent at the firſt nomination for the pleading is, <hi>quod adtunc &amp; ibid' penitus recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the great Objection relied upon at the Bar, and by the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> was, that <hi>Jeſſup,</hi> tho' he did refuſe, might have ſtill proceeded with the Vmpirage; and then if <hi>Clarke</hi> were well nominated, there ſhould be a concurrent Authority in ſeveral Perſons to make an Award, which the Law will not ſuffer, as the Caſe of <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>King, Rol. Abr. 262.</hi> and <hi>Sty. 306.</hi> where the ſubmiſſion was to the Award of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> ſo ſo that they made the Award within ſuch a time; and if they made no Award, then to the Award or Vmpirage of <hi>C.</hi> ſo as he made his Award within the ſame time; and the Pleading was; that the Arbitrators <hi>denegaſſent facere Arbitrium</hi> within the time, <hi>&amp; ſuperinde C.</hi> made an Award within the time, and it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged that the Award was void, becauſe the Arbitrators, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the denial, might have made an Award, and the Vmpire could have no power till their power was determined. And the Caſe of <hi>Barber</hi> and <hi>Giles, 1 Ro. Abr. 261:</hi> is to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:51792:297"/>To which it was anſwered, That if it be admitted that <hi>Jeſſup,</hi> after his refuſal, might have taken upon him the Vmpirage in caſe the Arbitrators had named no other Vmpire, yet 'tis clear <hi>Jeſſup</hi> could not have accepted the Vmpirage after another was named; for the Arbitrators naming another upon his refuſal, had quite taken away their firſt nomination; and in caſe <hi>Jeſſup</hi> had accepted before they had proceeded to name another, then the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators had been prevented naming of any other; ſo here could be no concurrent Power at all, <hi>Vide</hi> the Caſe of <hi>Frall</hi> and <hi>Brierly, 2 Ro. Abr. 261.</hi> Where the ſubmiſſion was to two Arbitrators, and if they did not agree within a certain time, then to the Vmpirage of ſuch an one as they ſhould chooſe, ſo that the Vmpire made his Award within the ſame time: And it was ſhewn that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators made no Award, and they choſe an Vmpire who made an Award within the time; and that was held good, becauſe they had determined their Power by chooſing an Vmpire, and ſo it differed from the Caſe of <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> where the Vmpire was named in the ſubmiſſion; and the Caſe of <hi>Copping</hi> and <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 2 Saunders 129.</hi> where the ſubmiſſion was to Arbitrators, and if they made no Award, and could not agree in ſuch a time, then to the Arbitrament of <hi>J. S.</hi> ſo that he made an Award within the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>In an Action brought upon the Award made by the Vmpire, it was ſet forth, that the Arbitrators made no Award, <hi>nec facere potuerunt aliquod Arbitrium inter Partes,</hi> and that the Vmpire made an Award within the time; upon a Demurrer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, Iudgment was given for the Defendant; for the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>quod non potuerunt facere Arbitrium</hi> was idle, for it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they might have made an Award within the time: But as 'tis reported by <hi>Saunders,</hi> if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had ſet forth that they had declared they would make no Award. Then all the <hi>Court</hi> held (except <hi>Twyſden Juſtice</hi>) that the Award of the Vmpire had been good.</p>
                     <p>And this <hi>Ventris</hi> ſaid did ſomewhat ſhake the Authority of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard and Kings</hi> Caſe.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Pollexfen, Chief Juſtice,</hi> ſaid he had taken a report of the Caſe of <hi>Copping</hi> and <hi>Horner,</hi> and produced his Report, where there was no mention of that laſt Opinion reported by <hi>Saunders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, no Caſe could be put that where a man that was veſted with a bare Authority, his denial or refuſal to execute it could conclude him, but that notwithſtanding he might execute his Authority; but if he makes a void or inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent execution he may do it over again. There is no reaſon he ſaid to take the words <hi>adtunc &amp; ibidem penitus recuſavit,</hi> that he was preſent, and that the nomination was but a communication or propoſal, for if he had notice of it many days after, and refuſed,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51792:297"/>
the pleading might be the ſame, and no <hi>Traverſe</hi> could be taken to the <hi>adtunc &amp; ibidem.</hi> Where a man is to be veſted with an Intereſt his Acceptance is neceſſary; but it ſignifies nothing when but a bare Authority. In the Caſes of <hi>Awards</hi> the Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>nullum fecerunt arbitrium,</hi> and 'tis never pleaded that they were not Arbitrators, or that they refuſed to be Arbitrators; for the Submiſſion makes them ſo, the pleading <hi>ſuſcepto ſuper ſe onere arbitrii</hi> is but meer Form. Leſſee for years aſſigns upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to obtain the aſſent of the Leſſor; the Leſſor at firſt denies, he may after Conſent, and 'tis a good performance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>14 H. 7. 17.</hi> This is properly an Authority in the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators; 'tis ſo taken in <hi>Vinyor</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>8 Co.</hi> and is revokable as other Authorities are.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the Chief Reaſons upon which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> relyed.</p>
                     <p>But Iudgment was given for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> by the Opinion of the other three <hi>Juſtices.</hi>

not repairing the Pavements, traverſeth that alſo, and the like as to repairing of Tiles and Walls.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> as to the not repairing of one Houſe, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration mentioned, and delivering it up well repaired, demurs to the <hi>Defendants</hi> Plea; which Demurrer came to be argued this Term, and the ſole queſtion was upon this Covenant, whether the <hi>Defendant,</hi> being obliged only to build three Houſes, and having built one more, whether the Covenant did not bind him to repair and deliver up that Houſe well repaired, as well as thoſe which were agreed to be built: And the Court were of Opinion that the Covenant did extend to the other Houſe as well as to the three which were agreed to be built: For in the laſt Covenant, which is to deliver up well repaired, 'tis <hi>dicta premiſſa, ac Domos &amp; Edificia ſuperinde fore erect,</hi> which is general; and 'tis the rather ſo to be taken, becauſe in the firſt Covenant for keeping in repair during the term; 'tis the Houſes agreed to be built, which words, <hi>agreed to be built,</hi> are left out in the laſt Covenant, which the Court took to be a diſtinct Covenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rokeby</hi> doubted, it ſeeming to him to be all as one Covenant, and ſo all the ſubſequent matter concerning leaving the Houſes well repaired, ſhould be reſtrained and underſtood of thoſe agreed to be built.</p>
                     <p>But Iudgment was given for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> upon the reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo objected on the part of the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that <hi>Dowſe</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was not an Aſſignee in this Caſe to bring Covenant, for that the term in the reverſion was deviſed to him for Life only; and if he died within the Term, then to his firſt Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this it was anſwered, that the Deviſe of the term to him, paſſed the whole Eſtate, and the remainder to the Son was but a poſſibility, and an executory Deviſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> demurred to this Declaration, for that he ſues for a quarters Rent upon each Demiſe, ending at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> whereas there were two quarters incurred before, which he doth not ſhew were paid, and ſo ſues for leſs, than upon his own ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeareth to be due; and the Caſe of <hi>Baily</hi> and <hi>Offord, 3 Cro.</hi> was cited, where upon a Demiſe, rendring <hi>31 s per annum</hi> at our <hi>Lady Day</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> declared for <hi>15 s</hi> and <hi>6 d</hi> due for a years rent, ending at our <hi>Lady Day,</hi> and held naught, becauſe he demands but <hi>15 s</hi> and <hi>6 d</hi> and doth not ſhew that the reſt of the years Rent was ſatisfied; and the Caſe of <hi>Clothwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> in <hi>3 Cro.</hi> where in a Writ of annuity the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> demanded the Arrears; incurred at <hi>Michaelmas, 3 Car. 1.</hi> and brought his Writ the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>April 4 Car. 1.</hi> and ſaid in that Caſe by <hi>Maynard,</hi> that a man cannot bring an Action for part of a Debt without he ſhews the reſt ſatisfied, <hi>Vide 2 Cro. 499.</hi>

                     <p>But the Court gave Iudgement for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and ſaid this was not like the Caſes cited; for in the firſt Caſe of <hi>Baily</hi> the whole years Rent is ſaid to be due, and yet demands but half a year: And for the Caſe of <hi>Clothworthy,</hi> there the Iudgment as appears by <hi>3 Cro.</hi> and <hi>Ro.

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded not guilty, and a Verdict was for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi> And it was moved in Arreſt of Iudgment, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had not in his Declaration ſet forth a ſufficient Cauſe of Action; for he ſaith that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had not folded his Sheep upon the <hi>160</hi> Acres as he ought; and it is not ſet forth, that the Cuſtom was for the Owner of the Sheep to bring his Sheep to fold them upon the ſaid Lands.</p>
                     <p>But it was objected on the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> part, that the word <hi>Folda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium</hi> did imply as much, and it was the uſage in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> for the Owner of the Sheep to put his Sheep into the Lords Land and fold them there, for which the Lord provided Hurdles, and prepared the Fold to receive them; and of this <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagium</hi> a Fine was levied of <hi>inter al'</hi> as is reported in <hi>1 Ed. 3. fo. 2.</hi> and the uſage in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> is there mentioned. And it was ſaid in a Poſſeſſory Action 'tis enough to ſay <hi>ſicut debuit,</hi> without ſetting forth any particular Cuſtom or Preſcription: And <hi>Dent</hi> and <hi>Olivers</hi> Caſe was cited, <hi>2 Cro. 122.</hi> where an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was brought for diſturbing of him in taking of Toll <hi>ad Feriam ipſius le Plaintiff ſpectan';</hi> and it was moved after Verdict, that he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51792:308"/>
made no Title by Preſcription or Cuſtom to the Toll, and it was held by the Court to be ſufficient in a poſſeſſory Action to ſay, <hi>ad Feriam ſuam ſpectant':</hi> So alſo in an Action for ſtopping of a way belonging to his Houſe, without ſetting forth any Preſcription, between St. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Moody,</hi> a late Caſe; and if this <hi>ſicut debuit</hi> is not ſufficient, 'tis laid further in the Declaration, that he did not permit the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to have the benefit of this Foldage.</p>
                     <p>But the Court held the Declaration inſufficient, for that there is no Authority in any Book of Law to ſhew that the word <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagium</hi> did imply ſo much as was pretended on the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> part; <hi>Faldagium</hi> is to have Sheep folded in his ground, as <hi>Falde curſus</hi> is a Sheep-walk or feed for his Sheep; and if it be the uſage in caſe of Foldage for the Owner of the Sheep to bring his Sheep to the Fold, it ought to have been ſo ſet forth, for the Court can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take notice of the private uſages of Countries; and if the <hi>Faldagium</hi> did imply what the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> would have it, then it ſhould have been ſet forth, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had ſet up a Fold in the Land where the Sheep were to have been folded, for he was to do the firſt act, which muſt have been ſhewn, if all the particulars had been ſet forth; and <hi>ſicut debuit</hi> is not enough here for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the word <hi>Faldavit;</hi> ſo that it doth not appear to the Court what ought to have been done on the <hi>Defendants</hi> part; and to ſay <hi>non permiſit Querentem habere beneficium Faldagii,</hi> was not good without ſhewing how he diſturbed him, as <hi>8 Co.</hi> in <hi>Francis</hi> Caſe. <hi>Sed nota,</hi> That was upon Demurrer; but here 'tis not ſaid <hi>non permiſit</hi> the <hi>Plaintiff habere Faldagium,</hi> or <hi>non permiſit eum faldare,</hi> but <hi>non habere beneficium faldagii;</hi> ſo that it was not certain what was meant, for the Sheep might be folded, and yet he might be deprived of the benefit of the foldage: And the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, here the Preſcription is laid to have the Sheep going <hi>infra Communes Campos &amp; Territoria de Granceſter</hi> to be folded, and <hi>Territoria</hi> is a word unknown in the Law, ſo no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the Preſcription.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> Here a Preſcription is laid in a Body Aggregate, in a <hi>que</hi> Eſtate, but that was held to be well enough, becauſe for a thing appurtenant to the Mannor, <hi>Vide 2 Cro. 673.

                     <p>The Court were of Opinion as to the firſt matter, that it was a good Grant, the Indenture being between <hi>Nicholas Coſſen</hi> of the one part, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of the other part; and then after a recital ſaith, <hi>hath Given and Granted to</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That muſt be taken, that <hi>Nicholas Coſſen</hi> hath Given and Granted, and that the Coniſans ſetting her forth to be ſeiſed for Life, whereas there paſſed an Eſtate in Fee, was a material variance.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cheif Juſtice Pollexfen</hi> ſeemed to incline, that it was a Rent-charge for Life, for the power of Diſtreſs was given to her only for Life, and a Rent-ſeck in Fee, and that it was as a Grant of two ſeveral Rents, and then the Pleading was good.</p>
                     <p>But the other <hi>Juſtices</hi> held it was one entire Rent, and that ſhe had it with a Priviledge of Diſtreſs during her Life only; but leave was given to amend the Coniſans upon payment of Coſts.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Here is a grant of the Rent from <hi>Richard Marſh</hi> pleaded without any Attornment or Enrollment To which it was anſwered by the Counſel for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that it appeareth that the Grant was made in Conſideration of Natural Affection as well as Mony, and ſo it ſhall enure as a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed; and for this the Caſe of <hi>Croſſing</hi> and <hi>Scudamore</hi> was cited, <hi>Paſ. 23 Car. 2. Rot. 871.</hi> where in <hi>Ejectment</hi> it was found by Special Verdict that <hi>Nicholas Hele</hi> was ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, and that he made a Deed to <hi>Jane Hele,</hi> enrolled within ſix Months, by which he did, for and in conſideration of Natural Love, Augmentation of her Portion, and the Preferment of Her in Marriage, and other good and valuable Conſiderations, Give, Grant, Bargain and Sell, Alien, Enfeoff and Confirm unto the ſaid <hi>Jane</hi> and her Heirs the ſaid Lands. And in the ſaid Deed there was a Covenant, that after due execution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Jane</hi> ſhould quietly enjoy, and alſo a clauſe of warranty; and the Iury found that there was no other Conſideration than what was expreſſed in the Deed, <hi>ut ſupra;</hi> this Deed could not enure as a Bargain and Sale, but it was adjudged that it ſhould work as a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed; and <hi>Watts</hi> and <hi>Dix</hi>'s Caſe was alſo cited, <hi>Sty. 188, 204</hi> where <hi>Rolls</hi> ſaid if Lands are paſſed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51792:314"/>
for Mony only, the Deed ought to be enrolled, but if for Mony and Natural Affection the Land will paſs without En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollment.</p>
                     <p>The Court here in the Principal Caſe inclined, that this Grant would work as a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Pollexfen Chief Juſtice</hi> was of Opinion that it ought to have been ſo pleaded, and not to uſe the words <hi>conceſſit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. &amp; tranſpoſuit,</hi> which is to plead it as a Grant at Common Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Powell</hi> and <hi>Ventris</hi> did conceive that it was pleaded ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, in regard it was ſaid that by virtue of the Deed and Statute of Vſes he became ſeiſed; but leave was given by the Court to amend the Plea as the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhould ſee cauſe.</p>

                        <hi>Torts</hi> are in their nature ſeveral, ſo one <hi>Defendant</hi> may be found guilty and the other not guilty, but 'tis not ſo in Actions grounded upon Contract.</p>

                        <hi>Pollexfen Chief Juſtice, Powel</hi> and <hi>Rokeby</hi> were of Opinion in this Caſe, That the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> could not have Iudgment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ventris</hi> inclined to the contrary, he admitted if an <hi>Indebitat' aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit</hi> be brought againſt four, and they plead <hi>non aſſumpſ.</hi> and found that one of them aſſumed, this is againſt the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> for he fails in his Action. But in the caſe at Bar it may be taken, that they did all promiſe at firſt, and that one of them only renewed the promiſe within ſix years: The plea of <hi>non aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit infra ſex annos</hi> implies a promiſe at firſt, and if one ſhould renew his promiſe within ſix years 'tis reaſon it ſhould bind him, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> muſt ſue them all, or elſe he will vary from the Original Contract.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſeemed to be of an Opinion, that if the promiſe were renewed within the ſix years, yet if not upon a new Conſideration, it ſhould not bind; and if there were a new Conſideration, the Action will lie againſt him that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51792:315"/>
alone. <hi>Sed Quaere,</hi> for the common Practice is upon a Plea of the Statute of <hi>Limitations</hi> to prove only a renewing the Promiſe without any further Conſideration, but a bare owning the Debt is not taken to be ſufficient, <hi>Quaere,</hi> if the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration upon repeating the Promiſe within ſix years be not enough to raiſe a new Cauſe of Action. Iudgment was given for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                     <p>To this the <hi>Defendant</hi> Demurred generally, and it was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that the <hi>Plea</hi> was naught both as to the Matter and Form. It was ſaid, the great Caſe of <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Manby</hi> was Reſolved chiefly upon the expreſs <hi>Prohibition</hi> that the Husband had given to Truſt his Wife. <hi>Mod. Rep. 9. Dier and Eaſt</hi> it was ſaid That the <hi>Wife</hi> ſhould have been Endowed tho' ſhe eloped before the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Weſtm. 2. cap. 34.</hi> and as to the manner of pleading, it is altogether inſufficient; for it amounts to the <hi>General Iſſue,</hi> and he ſhould have traverſed the <hi>Requeſt:</hi> And for the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Wares</hi> alledged to be ſold to the <hi>Defendant</hi> himſelf, there is no Anſwer given at all; but only ſaid, <hi>That the Wares ſuppoſed to be ſold to the Defendant, were ſold and delivered to the Wife;</hi> which is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court,</hi> as to the <hi>Special Matter</hi> pleaded, gave no Opinion; but ſeemed to agree, that upon <hi>Non Aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, the <hi>Matter</hi> ſet forth in the Plea would have been good Evidence for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> the Opinion of ſome of the <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>2 Siderfin</hi> in <hi>Scot and Manby's Caſe 129.</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> held that the Plea amounted to the <hi>General Iſſue,</hi> as to the Lodging found for the <hi>Wiſe;</hi> but then this was cured upon a <hi>General Demurrer.</hi> But becauſe there was nothing pleaded to the <hi>Indebitat' Aſſumpſit</hi> laid for the <hi>Wares</hi> alledged to be ſold to the <hi>Defendant</hi> himſelf, they were of Opinion to give <hi>Judgment</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>

                     <p>And the <hi>Court</hi> were of Opinion, that the Plea in <hi>Bar</hi> was good in this Caſe; but they took the Caſe of <hi>Putt and Royſton</hi> to be a Caſe of the ſame nature. For tho' the <hi>Iſſue</hi> were General, yet in regard of the <hi>Averments</hi> which in every ſuch Plea there muſt be, it appears to the <hi>Court</hi> that the Matter was the ſame, as well as here it doth upon the <hi>Special Verdict;</hi> and if it were not the ſame, ſo that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was barred to the former by miſtaking the Nature of his Action, the <hi>Averment</hi> might be traverſed: Therefore by reaſon of that Caſe Adjudged and the Importunity of the <hi>Plaintiffs,</hi> Leave was given by the <hi>Court</hi> to ſpeak further to the Caſe the next <hi>Term.</hi>

                     <p>It was ſaid, that tho' Suits had ſometimes been permitted there for <hi>Marriners Wages,</hi> yet that was when they all joyned in the Suit, to avoid the putting them to Sue ſeverally, as they muſt do at Law.

                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> denied the <hi>Prohibition;</hi> for they have been ever alowed to proceed for <hi>Marriners Wages;</hi> and tho' the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> have an employment in the Ship, as <hi>Purfer, Boatſwain,</hi> or the like, they are <hi>Marriners</hi> as well as others, and may ſue in the <hi>Admiral Court</hi> for their <hi>Wages,</hi> and they having Iurisdiction ſhall proceed in their own way, tho' different from our Law as to the joyning of all the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> or <hi>Defendants,</hi> and if the Proceeding be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Law, the Remedy lies there.</p>

                     <p>To this Avowry the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> pleaded an inſufficient and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Bar, and now took Exceptions to the <hi>Avowry;</hi> for that the ſaid <hi>Jane Croſs</hi> is therein ſet forth to have been ſeiſed in Fee of the ſaid Meſſuage at the Will of the <hi>Lord,</hi> according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Mannor, and ſheweth no admiſſion from the <hi>Lord;</hi> whereas a <hi>Copyholder</hi> cannot plead his Eſtate, without ſetting forth an <hi>Admiſſion</hi> or <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>Lord, 4 Co. 22. b.</hi>

                     <p>To this the <hi>Defendant</hi> demurred, and the Cauſe of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer</hi> was upon the late Statute for reviving of <hi>Proceſs, anno primo Willielmi &amp; Mariae,</hi> by which it is provided, in regard there was an Interruption of the <hi>Government</hi> and proceedings of <hi>Law,</hi> from the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>September 1688.</hi> to the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that the time within thoſe Days ſhould not be accounted as any part of the ſix years to barr an Action by the Statute of <hi>Limitations,</hi> or of the <hi>ſix Months</hi> for bringing a <hi>Quare Impedit, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as it was urged, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhould have ſhewn, that ſix Years and ſo many Days were elapſed as are between the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> and the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>February.</hi> For tho' ſix years may be paſſed, yet the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> may be within time by reaſon of the ſaid Statute.</p>

And they further ſaid, That <hi>Thomas,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in the ſaid Year <hi>1687.</hi> after the Death of <hi>Juce,</hi> and ſome time before the Death of <hi>Michael,</hi> granted the ſaid Office of <hi>Regiſter</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant Fox,</hi> and ſet forth the Grant in <hi>haec verba,</hi> which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the ſaid <hi>Regiſters Office</hi> to be void by the <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>5 &amp; 6 Ed. 6.</hi> againſt <hi>Sale of Offices,</hi> and that thereupon it belonged to the ſaid <hi>Biſhop</hi> to grant the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> by virtue of which the said <hi>Fox</hi> became ſeiſed of the ſaid <hi>Office prout lex poſtulat.</hi> And they find afterwards, that in the ſame Year that <hi>Juce</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> died, <hi>Hammond</hi> being <hi>Archdeacon</hi> (as aforeſaid) granted the ſaid <hi>Office</hi> to the Plaintiffs, <hi>Woodward, Maſters</hi> and <hi>Gilbert,</hi> for their Lives; and that they entred upon the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> and became ſeiſed thereof <hi>ꝓut lex poſtulat.</hi> And they find that the <hi>Biſhops Grant</hi> was Afterwards Confirmed by the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter;</hi> and they find, that afterwards, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>22</hi> of <hi>Octob. Anno regni <hi>Willielmi</hi> &amp; <hi>Mariae</hi> primo,</hi> the ſaid <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> their <hi>Letters Patents</hi> under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> reciting, that the ſaid <hi>Office</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to Their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> to grant by the ſaid <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> did grant the ſaid Office of <hi>Regiſter</hi> to the ſaid Plaintiffs <hi>Woodward, Maſters</hi> and <hi>Gilbert,</hi> for their Lives, and that by virtue thereof they entred upon and exerciſed the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51792:333"/>
received divers Fees and Profits thereunto belonging; and that the <hi>Defendant</hi> having notice thereof, did take divers Fees and Profits of the ſaid <hi>Office,</hi> amounting to <hi>30 l</hi> claiming them to his own uſe, &amp;c. and if upon the whole Matter, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this <hi>Special Verdict</hi> there were theſe Points mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt Point</hi> was, Whether this Office of <hi>Regiſter</hi> could be granted for Lives?</p>
                     <p>This was not much inſiſted on by the <hi>Defendants Council,</hi> it having been uſually granted, and ſo found by the <hi>Verdict, 3 Cro. Young</hi> and <hi>Fowler</hi>'s Caſe, a Grant in Reverſion of the <hi>Regiſters Office</hi> was allowed, being warranted by <hi>Uſage;</hi> and ſo in <hi>3 Cro. Young</hi> and <hi>Stoel.</hi> But unleſs there have been ſuch Vſage, 'tis not grantable in Reverſion. <hi>Vide 3 Cro. Walker</hi> and Sir <hi>John Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecond Point</hi> was, Whether the Grant of this <hi>Office,</hi> in Conſideration of <hi>Money,</hi> is void by the Statute of the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> againſt <hi>Sale of Offices?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Point</hi> was alſo waved, it being Reſolved in Dr. <hi>Trevor</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>12 Co. 78. 2 Cro. 269.</hi> foraſmuch as it concerned <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>third Point</hi> was, That the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>5 Ed. 6.</hi> Enacting, <hi>That the perſon who takes any Money for any Office, ſhall <hi>loſe and forfeit</hi> all his Right to any ſuch Office, &amp;c.</hi> Whether the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhall take advantage of this Forfeiture, in regard the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not expreſs who ſhall diſpoſe of the <hi>Office</hi> in ſuch caſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Co. Lit. 159. a.</note>And it was ſaid on the part of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> That when a <hi>Statute</hi> gives a Forfeiture, and not ſaid to whom, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall have it, <hi>11 Co. 60. a.</hi> unleſs there be a particular party grieved; as upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>2 Ed. 6.</hi> of <hi>Tythes;</hi> and yet it was for ſome time before it was ſetled, that the <hi>Parſon</hi> ſhould have the treble Value in that Caſe. And this agrees with the Reaſon of the <hi>Common Law;</hi> things that are <hi>nullius in bonis,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> ſhall have them as <hi>extra Parochial Tythes, 11 H. 4. 17. Vid. 5. Co.</hi> in Sir <hi>Henry Conſtable</hi>'s Caſe, The Soil of <hi>Navigable Rivers</hi> and <hi>derelict Lands</hi> was with this difference; If the Sea leaves the Land <hi>gradatim,</hi> and for but a little quantity, the Owner of the Land ſhall have it; but if in a great quantity at a time, it goes to the <hi>King, Davis Rep. 5. 6.

And in Sir <hi>John Breon</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Bridgm. 27.</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> gave Licenſe to make a <hi>Park</hi> in his <hi>Foreſt,</hi> and the party forfeited his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51792:333"/>
Office, the Earl had the advantage of it. In thoſe caſes the thing is forfeited to him from whom it was granted; as a <hi>Copyholder</hi> forfeits to his <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Tenant for Life</hi> to him in <hi>Reverſion;</hi> but here the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath nothing to do with the Office of <hi>Regiſter,</hi> he cannot diſpoſe of it in the time of Vacancy of the <hi>Archdeaconry.</hi> The <hi>Verdict</hi> finds, that his Office is to Regiſter the Acts in the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> and he muſt anſwer for his <hi>Regiſter</hi> as his Superiour: And as this <hi>Verdict</hi> is found, it may be taken as an <hi>Archdeaconry</hi> by <hi>Preſcription,</hi> and then it has no dependance upon the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but wholly exempt, <hi>Godolphin 61.</hi> and <hi>5 Co. 15.</hi> in <hi>Cawdry</hi>'s Caſe.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51792:338"/>
Teſtator for ever; and that the ſaid <hi>Nicholas</hi> died ſeiſed of the Premiſſes, and after his deceaſe the ſaid <hi>Simon Leach</hi> entred and became ſeiſed for Life, with Remainders over, as aforeſaid; and being ſo ſeiſed made a <hi>Deed,</hi> hearing date the <hi>23th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the <hi>25th</hi> year of the Reign of the ſaid King <hi>Charles,</hi> ſealed and delivered to the uſe of the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> (but he was not preſent) which <hi>Deed</hi> the <hi>Verdict</hi> ſets forth in <hi>haec verba;</hi> and by if he granted and ſurrendred to the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> his Heirs and Aſſigns, the ſaid Mannor and Premiſſes, the Reverſion and Reverſions, Remainder and Remainders of the ſame: To have and to hold the ſame to the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> and his Heirs, to the uſe of him and his Heirs; and they find that the ſaid <hi>Charles Leach,</hi> Leſſor of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> the firſt Son of the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> was born the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> in the <hi>25th</hi> year of the Reign of the ſaid King <hi>Charles,</hi> and not before; and that <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> from the time of his Sealing the <hi>Deed</hi> to the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the <hi>30th</hi> year of the ſaid King <hi>Charles,</hi> continued poſſeſſed of the Premiſſes; and that then, and not before, Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> accepted and agreed to the ſaid Surrender, and entred into the Premiſſes; and that afterwards the ſaid <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> Brother of the ſaid <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Teſtator died, and the ſaid <hi>Charles Leach</hi> his Son, after his deceaſe entred into the Premiſſes, and demiſed them to the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> who by virtue thereof entred and became poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo continued till the ſaid <hi>Simon Leach</hi> and the other <hi>Defendants,</hi> by his Command, ejected him. But whether, upon the whole Matter, the ſaid <hi>Simon Leach</hi> did ſurrender the ſaid Mannor and Premiſſes to the ſaid Sir <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> before the ſaid <hi>Charles Leach</hi> was born; and if he did not ſurrender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the birth of the ſaid <hi>Charles Leach,</hi> then they find the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> Guilty; and if he did ſurrender them before the birth, then they find for the <hi>Defendants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Pollexfen Chief Juſtice, Powell</hi> and <hi>Rokeby,</hi> were of Opinion that here was no Surrender till ſuch time as Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> had notice of the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender,</hi> and agreed to it, and ſo the Remainder was veſted in <hi>Charles</hi> the Son; and it was not defeated by the Agreement of Sir <hi>Simon</hi> after his birth, to the <hi>Surrender.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ventris</hi> differed, and his Argument was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</p>
                     <p>Whom this <hi>Record</hi> the Caſe is no more than this; <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> Tenant for Life, Remainder to his firſt Son, Remainder in Call to Sir <hi>Simon Leach. Simon Leach</hi> before the birth of that Son by <hi>Deed,</hi> ſealed and delivered to the uſe of Sir <hi>Simon</hi> (but in his Abſence and without his Notice) ſurrenders his Eſtate to Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> and continues the poſſeſſion until after the birth of his Son; and then Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> agrees to the Surrender,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51792:339"/>
Whether this <hi>Surrender</hi> ſhall be taken as a good and effectual <hi>Surrender</hi> before the Son born?</p>
                     <p>There are two <hi>Points</hi> which have been ſpoken to in this Caſe at the Bar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether by the Sealing of the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender</hi> the <hi>Eſtate</hi> immediately paſſed to Sir <hi>Simon Leach;</hi> for then the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Remainder</hi> could not beſt in the after-born Son, there being no Eſtate left in <hi>Simon Leach</hi> his Father to ſupport it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether after the aſſent of Sir <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> tho' it where given after the birth of the Son, doth not ſo relate as to make it a <hi>Surrender</hi> from the Sealing of the <hi>Deed,</hi> and thereby defeat the <hi>Remainder</hi> which before ſuch Aſſent was veſted in the Son?</p>
                     <p>I think theſe <hi>Points</hi> include all that is material in the Caſe, and I ſhall ſpeak to the <hi>Second Point,</hi> becauſe I would rid it out of the Caſe. For as to that <hi>Point</hi> I conceive, that if it be admitted, that the <hi>Eſtate for Life</hi> continued in <hi>Simon Leach</hi> till the Aſſent of Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> that the <hi>Remainder</hi> being veſted in <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond Son before ſuch Aſſent, there can be no Relation that ſhall diveſt it.</p>
                     <p>I do not go upon the General Rule, That <hi>Relations ſhall not do wrong to Strangers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, <hi>Relations</hi> are fictions in Law, which are always accompanied with <hi>Equity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 'tis as true, that there is ſometimes loſs and damage to <hi>Third Perſons</hi> conſequent upon them; but then 'tis what the Law calls <hi>Damnum abſque injuria,</hi> which is a known and ſtated difference in the Law, as my Brother <hi>Pemberton</hi> urged it. But I think there needs nothing of that to be conſiderrd in this <hi>Point.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Reaſon which I go upon is, That the <hi>Relation</hi> here, let it be never ſo ſtrong, cannot hurt or diſturb the <hi>Remainder</hi> in <hi>Charles Leach</hi> in this Caſe; for that the <hi>Remainder</hi> is in him by a <hi>Title</hi> antecedent and paramount to the <hi>Deed</hi> of Surrender, to which the Aſſent of Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> relates, ſo that it plainly over-reaches the <hi>Relation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in <hi>Remainder,</hi> or otherwiſe, ariſeth to one upon a Contingency or a Power reſerved upon a <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Feoffment</hi> to Vſes, when the Eſtate is once raiſed or veſted it relates to the <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Feoffment,</hi> as if it were immediately limited thereupon, <hi>1 Co. 133, 156.</hi> So this <hi>Remainder,</hi> when veſted in <hi>Charles,</hi> he is in immediately by the <hi>Will,</hi> and out of danger of his <hi>Remainder</hi> being diveſted by any act done ſince, as the Surrender is.</p>
                     <p>I will put one Caſe, I think full to this Matter, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs this <hi>Point.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:51792:339"/>It cannot be denied, but that there is as ſtrong a <hi>Relation</hi> upon a diſagreement to an Eſtate, as upon an agreement, where the Eſtate was Conveyed without the Notice of him that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards agrees of diſagrees; if the Husband diſcontinues the Wives Eſtate, and then the <hi>Diſcontinuee</hi> conveys the Eſtate back to the Wife in the abſence of the Husband, who (as ſoon as he knows of it) diſagrees to the Eſtate, this ſhall not take away the <hi>Remitter</hi> which the Law wrought upon the firſt taking the Eſtate from the <hi>Diſcontinuee.</hi> And ſo is <hi>Litt. cap. Remitter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jones 78.</note> 
                        <hi>Co. 11 Inſt. 356. b.</hi> The true Reaſon is, becauſe ſhe is in of a <hi>Title</hi> paramount to the <hi>Conveyance</hi> to which the Diſagreement relates, tho' that indeed was the foundation of the <hi>Remitter,</hi> which by the Diſagreement might ſeem to be avoided. This therefore I take to be a ſtronger Caſe than that at the Bar: So that if there were no Surrender before the birth of <hi>Charles</hi> the Son, there can be none after by any Conſtruction of Law; for that would be in avoidance of an Eſtate ſettled by a <hi>Title</hi> antecedent to ſuch Surrender, whereas <hi>Relations</hi> are to avoid <hi>Meſn Acts;</hi> and I believe there can be no Caſe put upon <hi>Relations</hi> that go any further, and it would be againſt all Reaſon if it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>But as to the firſt <hi>Point,</hi> I am of Opinion, that upon the making of the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender,</hi> the Freehold and Eſtate of <hi>Simon Leach</hi> did immediately veſt in Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> before he had notice, of gave any expreſs conſent to it; and ſo it was a Surrender before <hi>Charles</hi> was born, and then the Contingent Remainder could never veſt in him, there being no particular Eſtate to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Surrender</hi> is a particular ſort of <hi>Conveyance</hi> that works by the <hi>Common Law.</hi> And it has been agreed, and I think I can make it plainly appear, that <hi>Conveyances</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> do immediately (upon the Execution of them on the Grantors part) diveſt the Eſtate out of him, and put it in the party to whom ſuch Conveyance is made, tho' in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or without his notice, till ſome diſagreement to ſuch Eſtate appears. I ſpeak of <hi>Conveyances</hi> at the <hi>Common Law;</hi> for I ſhall ſay nothing of <hi>Conveyances</hi> that work upon the Statute of <hi>Uſes,</hi> or of <hi>Conveyances</hi> by Cuſtom, as Surrenders of <hi>Copyholds,</hi> or the like, as being guided by the particular penning of Statutes, and by Cuſtom and Vſage, and Matters altogether foreign to the Caſe in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Conveyances</hi> that are by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>Deed</hi> is ſufficient (and in <hi>Surrenders</hi> ſometimes Words without a <hi>Deed</hi>) without further Circumſtance or Ceremony; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a further Act is requiſite to give them effect, as <hi>Livery</hi> of <hi>Seiſin, Attornment,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Entry</hi> of the party, as in caſe of <hi>Exchanges;</hi> and as well in thoſe <hi>Conveyances</hi> that require a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51792:340"/>
                        <hi>Deed</hi> only, as thoſe which require ſome further Act to perfect them, ſo ſoon as they are executed on the Grantors part, they immediately paſs the Eſtate. In caſe of a <hi>Deed</hi> of a <hi>Feoffment</hi> to divers perſons, and <hi>Livery</hi> made to one <hi>Feoffee</hi> in the abſence of the reſt, the Eſtate veſts in them all till Diſſent, <hi>2 Leon. 23. Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's Caſe.</hi> And ſo <hi>223.</hi> an Eſtate made to a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> by Livery, veſts in her before any Agreement of the Husband, <hi>Co. 1 Inſt. 356. a.</hi> So of a Grant of a Reverſion after Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Leſſee,</hi> paſſeth the <hi>Freehold</hi> by the Deed, <hi>Co. 1 Inſt. 49. a. Litt. Sect. 66.</hi> In caſe of a Leaſe, the <hi>Leſſee</hi> hath right immediately to have the <hi>Tenements</hi> by force of the Leaſe. So in the caſe of Limitation of <hi>Remainders</hi> and of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> (which tho' a <hi>Conveyance</hi> introduced by the Statute, yet operates according to the <hi>Common Law</hi>) the <hi>Freehold</hi> paſſeth to the <hi>Deviſee</hi> before notice or aſſent. I do not cite Authorities, which are plentiful enough in theſe matters, becauſe they that have Argued for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> have in a manner agreed, that in <hi>Conveyances</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> generally the Eſtate paſſeth to the party, till he diveſts it by ſome diſagreement.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis Objected, That in caſe of <hi>Surrenders,</hi> an expreſs aſſent of the <hi>Surrendree</hi> is a Circumſtance requiſite; as <hi>Attornment</hi> to a Grant of a <hi>Reverſion, Livery</hi> to a <hi>Feoffment,</hi> or <hi>Execution</hi> by <hi>Entry,</hi> in caſe of an Exchange.</p>
                     <p>To which I Anſwer, Than an Aſſent is not only a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but 'tis eſſential to all <hi>Conveyances;</hi> for they are Contracts, <hi>actus contra actum,</hi> which neceſſarily ſuppoſe the aſſent of all parties: But his is not at all to be compared with ſuch colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Acts of Circumſtances, that by the Poſitive Law are made the effectual parts of a <hi>Conveyance;</hi> as <hi>Attornment, Livery,</hi> or the like; for the Aſſent of the party that takes, is implied in all <hi>Conveyances,</hi> and this is by intendment of Law, which is as ſtrong as the Expreſſion of the party, till the contrary appears; <hi>ſtabit praeſumptio donec probetur in contrarium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to make this thing clear, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his firſt <hi>Inſtitutes, fol. 50.</hi> where he gives inſtances of <hi>Conveyances</hi> that work without <hi>Livery,</hi> or further Circumſtance or Ceremony, puts the Caſes of <hi>Leaſe</hi> and <hi>Releaſe, Confirmation, Deviſe</hi> and <hi>Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> amongſt the reſt; whereas if an expreſs Aſſent of the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendree</hi> were a Circumſtance to make it effectual, ſure he would have mentioned it, and not martiall'd it with ſuch <hi>Conveyances</hi> as I have ſhewn before, need no ſuch aſſent, nor any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a <hi>Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Caſe of <hi>Exchanges</hi> has been put as an Inſtance of a <hi>Conveyance</hi> at Law, that doth not work immediately; but that can't be compar'd to the Caſe in queſtion, but ſtands upon its particular Reaſons; for there muſt be a mutual expreſs Conſent,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51792:340"/>
becauſe in <hi>Exchanges</hi> there muſt be a Reciprocal <hi>Grant,</hi> as appears by <hi>Littleton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having, I hope, made out (and much more might have been added, but that I find it has been agreed) that <hi>Conveyances</hi> work immediately upon the Execution of them on the part of him that makes them, I will now endeavour to ſhew the Reaſons, why they do ſo immediately veſt the Eſtate in the party without any expreſs Conſent; and to ſhew that theſe Reaſons do hold as ſtrongly in caſe of <hi>Surrenders,</hi> as of any other Conveyances at Law; and then conſider the Inconveniences and ill Conſequences that have been Objected, would enſue, if <hi>Surrenders</hi> ſhould operate without an expreſs Conſent; and to ſhew, that the ſame are to be Objected as to all other <hi>Conveyances,</hi> and that very odd Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and Inconveniences would follow, if <hi>Surrenders</hi> ſhould be ineffectual till an expreſs Conſent of the <hi>Surrendree;</hi> and then ſhall endeavour to Anſwer the <hi>Arguments</hi> that have been made on the other Side, from the putting of Caſes of <hi>Surrenders</hi> in the <hi>Books,</hi> which are generally mentioned, to be with mutual Aſſent, and from the manner of Pleading of <hi>Surrenders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſons why <hi>Conveyances</hi> do diveſt the Eſtate out of the <hi>Grantor,</hi> before any expreſs Aſſent or perhaps Notice of the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi> I conceive to be theſe Three:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is a ſtrong Intendment of Law, that for a man to take an Eſtate it is for his benefit, and no man can be ſuppoſed to be unwilling to that which is for his Advantage. <hi>1 Rep. 44.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Smalman and Agbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> Where an Art is done for a mans benefit an Agreement is implied, till there be a Diſagreement. This does not hold only in <hi>Conveyances,</hi> but in the Gift of <hi>Goods, 3 Co. 26.</hi> A Grant of <hi>Goods</hi> veſts the property in the <hi>Grantee</hi> before Notice. So of things in Action; a <hi>Bond</hi> is ſealed and delivered to a mans uſe, who dies before Notice, his <hi>Executors</hi> may bring an Action. <hi>Dyer 167.</hi> An Eſtate made to a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> veſts in her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, till the Husband diſagrees. So is my Lord <hi>Hobart 204.</hi> in <hi>Swain and Holman's Caſe.</hi> Now is there not the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and appearance of Benefit to him in Reverſion in caſe of a Surrender? Is it not a palpable Advantage to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the particular Eſtate, and to reduce his Eſtate into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion? and therefore, why ſhould not his Affent be implied, as well as in other <hi>Conveyances?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> A ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe it would ſeem incongruous and abſurd, that when a <hi>Conveyance</hi> is compleatly executed on the <hi>Grantors</hi> part, yet notwithſtanding the Eſtate ſhould continue in him. The words of my Lord <hi>Coke (1 Inſt. 217. a)</hi> are, <hi>That it cannot ſtand with any Reaſon, that a Freehold ſhould remain in a man againſt his own Livery when there is a perſon able to take it.</hi> There needs only a Capacity to take, his Will to take is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51792:341"/>
Why ſhould it not ſeem as unreaſonable, that the Eſtate ſhould remain in <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> againſt his own <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender?</hi> For in caſe of a <hi>Surrender,</hi> a <hi>Deed,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Words</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Deed,</hi> are as effectual as a <hi>Livery</hi> in caſe of a <hi>Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third and principal Reaſon, as I take it, why the Law will not ſuffer the Operation of a <hi>Conveyance</hi> to be in ſuſpence, and to expect the Agreement of the party to whom 'twas made, is to prevent the Vncertainty of the <hi>Freehold.</hi> This I take to be the great Reaſon why a <hi>Freehold</hi> cannot be granted <hi>in futuro,</hi> becauſe that it would be very hard and inconvenient that a man ſhould be driven to bring his <hi>Praecipe</hi> or <hi>Real Action</hi> firſt againſt the <hi>Grantor,</hi> and after he had proceeded in it a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, it ſhould abate by the transferring the <hi>Freehold</hi> to a Stranger, by reaſon of his Agrement to ſome <hi>Conveyance</hi> made before the Writ brought; for otherwiſe there is nothing in the nature of the thing againſt Conveying a Freehold <hi>in futuro;</hi> for a Rent <hi>de novo</hi> may be ſo granted; becauſe that being newly Created, there can be no precedent Right to bring any <hi>Real Action</hi> for it, <hi>Palmer 29, 30.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in this Caſe, ſuppoſe a <hi>Praecipe</hi> had been brought againſt <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> this ſhould have proceeded, and he could not have pleaded in <hi>Abatement</hi> till Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> ha aſſented; and after a long progreſs in the Suit he might have pleaded, that Sir <hi>Simon Leach</hi> aſſented <hi>puis darrein continuance,</hi> and defeated all. So that the ſame Inconvenience, as to the bringing of <hi>Real Actions,</hi> holds in <hi>Surrenders,</hi> as in other <hi>Conveyances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to ſhew that it is not a ſlight matter, but what the Law much conſiders, and is very careful to have the <hi>Freehold</hi> fixed, and will never ſuffer it to be in abeyance, or under ſuch uncertainty; as a Stranger that demands Right ſhould not know where to fix his Action.</p>
                     <p>A multitude of Caſes might be cited; but I will cite only a Caſe put <hi>1 H. 6. 2. a.</hi> becauſe it ſeems ſomething of a ſingular nature, <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Villain, Mortgagor</hi> and <hi>Mortgagee,</hi> may be both made <hi>Tenants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it will be ſaid here, that if a <hi>Praecipe</hi> had been brought againſt Sir <hi>Simon Leach,</hi> might not he have pleaded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement, and ſo abated the Writ of <hi>Nontenure?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true; but that Inconvenience had been no more than in all other Caſes, a Plea of <hi>Nontenure,</hi> and it muſt have abated immediately; for he could not have abated it by any diſſent after he had anſwered to the Writ. Whereas I have ſhewn it in the other Caſe, it may be after a long progreſs in the Suit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51792:341"/>Again, It's very improbable that he ſhould diſſent; whereas on the other ſide, an <hi>Aſſent</hi> is the likelieſt thing in the world; ſo the miſchief to the <hi>Demandant</hi> is not near ſo great, nor the hundredth part ſo probable.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to conſider thoſe <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that have been urged that would enſue, if a <hi>Surrender</hi> ſhould work immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid, That a <hi>Tenant for Life</hi> might make ſuch <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender,</hi> and continue in poſſeſſion, and ſuffer a <hi>Recovery;</hi> and this might deſtroy a great many <hi>Recoveries,</hi> and overthrow <hi>Marriage Settlements,</hi> and defeat Charges and Securities upon his <hi>Eſtate</hi> after ſuch Deed of <hi>Surrender.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe, and a great many more ſuch like Miſchiefs, may be inſtanced in <hi>Surrenders;</hi> but they hold no leſs in any other <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,</hi> whereby a man may (as has been ſhewed before) diveſt himſelf of the Eſtate, and yet continue the Poſſeſſion; and in this Caſe the Aſſent of the <hi>Surrendree,</hi> tho' he doth not enter, would (as it is agreed of all hands) veſt the Eſtate in him, <hi>Hutton 95. Br. tit. Surrender 50.</hi> tho' he cannot have <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> before Entry, and that Aſſent might be kept as private, and let in all the Miſchiefs before mentioned as if no ſuch Aſſent were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                     <p>And this I think ſufficient to Anſwer to the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> objected on that ſide.</p>
                     <p>Now let us ſee what <hi>Inconveniences</hi> and odd <hi>Conſequences</hi> would follow, in caſe a <hi>Surrender</hi> could not operate till the expreſs Aſſent of the <hi>Surrendree,</hi> then no <hi>Surrender</hi> could be to an <hi>Infant</hi> at leaſt, when under the age of Diſcretion; for if it be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Circumſtance, it cannot be diſpenſed with no more than <hi>Livery</hi> or <hi>Attornment.</hi> So tho' an <hi>Infant</hi> of a year Old is capable to take an Eſtate, becauſe for his benefit he could not take a particular Eſtate, upon which he had a <hi>Reverſion</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately expectant, becauſe it muſt enure by Surrender. If there be <hi>Joyntenants</hi> in <hi>Reverſion,</hi> a Surrender to one of them enures to both, <hi>1 Inſt. 192, 214. a.</hi> ſo there, as to one Moiety, it operates without Aſſent or Notice.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe <hi>Tenant for Life</hi> ſhould make <hi>Livery</hi> upon a Grant of his Eſtate to him in Reverſion and two others, and the <hi>Livery</hi> is made to the other two in the abſence, and without the Notice of him in Reverſion, ſhould the <hi>Livery</hi> not work immediately for a Third part of the Eſtate? And if it doth, it muſt enure as a <hi>Surrender</hi> for a Third part. So is <hi>Bro. tit. Surrender,</hi> and <hi>3 Co. 76.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:51792:342"/>If <hi>Tenant for Life</hi> ſhould by <hi>Leaſe</hi> and <hi>Releaſe</hi> convey the Lands held by him for Life, together with other Lands to him in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion who knows nothing of the Sealing of the <hi>Deed;</hi> ſhould this paſs the other Lands preſently, and the Lands held for Life not till after an expreſs Aſſent, becauſe as to thoſe Lands it muſt work as a <hi>Surrender?</hi> Plainly an expreſs Aſſent is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. For if the <hi>Grantee</hi> enters, this is ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>I come in the laſt place to Anſwer thoſe <hi>Arguments</hi> that have been made from the manner of putting the Caſe of <hi>Surrenders</hi> in the <hi>Book,</hi> and the Form of pleading <hi>Surrenders, Co. 1 Inſt. 337. b.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> A <hi>Surrender</hi> is a yielding up of the Eſtate, which drowns by mutual Agreement between them. <hi>Tenant for Life,</hi> by Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him in Reverſion, ſurrenders to him; he hath a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> before he enters. And ſo <hi>Perkins,</hi> in putting the Caſe of a <hi>Surrender,</hi> mentions an <hi>Agreement;</hi> and divers other <hi>Books</hi> have been cited to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>To all which I Anſwer:</p>
                     <p>No doubt but an <hi>Agreement</hi> is neceſſary. But the Queſtion is, Whether an <hi>Agreement</hi> is not intended where a <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender</hi> is made in the abſence of him in the Reverſion; whether the Law ſhall not ſuppoſe an <hi>Aſſent,</hi> till a Diſagreement appears?</p>
                     <p>Indeed, if he were preſent', he muſt agree or diſagree immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; and ſo 'tis in all other <hi>Conveyances.</hi> The Caſes put in <hi>Perkins, Sect. 607, 608, 609.</hi> are all of <hi>Surrenders</hi> made to the <hi>Leſſor</hi> in perſon; for thus he puts them: The <hi>Leſſee</hi> comes to the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> and the <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Leſſor, I ſurrender,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if the Leſſor doth not agree,</hi> 'tis void: <hi>Car il ne poit ſurrender à luy maugre ſon dents.</hi> And that is certainly ſo in <hi>Surrenders,</hi> and all other <hi>Conveyances;</hi> for a man cannot have an Eſtate put into him in ſpight of his Teeth.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot find any of the <hi>Books</hi> cited that come to this Point, <hi>That where a Deed of Surrender is executed without the Notice of him in Reverſion, that it ſhall paſs nothing till he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents;</hi> ſo that it cannot be ſaid, that there is any expreſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to the Form of Pleading of a <hi>Surrender</hi> it has been Objected, That a <hi>Surrender</hi> is always pleaded with <hi>Acceptance;</hi> and many Caſes have been cited of ſuch <hi>Pleadings, Raſtal's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries 176, 177. Fitzh. tit. Barre 262.</hi> which are Caſes in <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Debt for Rent,</hi> and the <hi>Defendant</hi> in Bar pleads, That he ſurrendred before the <hi>Rent</hi> grew due, and ſhews, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> accepted the <hi>Surrender:</hi> So in <hi>Waſte</hi> brought, a <hi>Surrender</hi> pleaded with the <hi>Agreement</hi> of the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:51792:342"/>Theſe and the like Caſes have been very materially, and I think fully Anſwered at the Bar by my Brother <hi>Pemberton;</hi> That thoſe <hi>Actions</hi> being in Diſaffirmance of the <hi>Surrender,</hi> and implying a <hi>Diſagreement,</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> had no way to bar or avoid ſuch <hi>Diſagreement,</hi> but by ſhewing an expreſs <hi>Agreement</hi> before.</p>
                     <p>The Caſe of <hi>Peto</hi> and <hi>Pemberton</hi> in the <hi>3 Cro. 101.</hi> that has been ſo often cited, is of the ſame ſort: In a <hi>Replevin</hi> the <hi>Avowry</hi> was for a <hi>Rent-charge;</hi> in Bar of which 'tis pleaded, That the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> demiſed the Land out of which the <hi>Rent</hi> iſſued, to the <hi>Avowant.</hi> The <hi>Avowant</hi> Replies, That he ſurrendred <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem praedict.</hi> to which the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> agreed. This is the ſame with Pleading in <hi>Bar</hi> to an <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Debt for Rent:</hi> But when the <hi>Action</hi> is in purſuance of the <hi>Surrender,</hi> then it is not pleaded.</p>
                     <p>So is <hi>Raſt. Entries 136.</hi> The <hi>Leſſee</hi> brought an Action <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> for entring upon him, and ouſting of him. The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleads a <hi>Surrender</hi> in <hi>Bar,</hi> and that without any <hi>Agreement</hi> or <hi>Acceptance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Fitzherbert, tit. Debt. 149.</hi> where the Caſe is in an <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Debt for Rent:</hi> The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded in Bar, that he ſurrendred, by force of which the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> became ſeiſed: There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleading any <hi>Agreement,</hi> notwithſtanding that the <hi>Action</hi> was in Diſaffirmance of the <hi>Surrender.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, as to the Argument which has been drawn againſt the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Pleading,</hi> I ſay, that if an <hi>Agreement</hi> be neceſſary to be pleaded: Then, I ſay,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That 'tis anſwer'd by an <hi>implied Aſſent,</hi> as well as an <hi>expreſs Aſſent.</hi> I would put the Caſe; Suppoſe a <hi>Leſſee for Life</hi> ſhould make a Leaſe for years, reſerving Rent; and in Debt for the Rent the <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhould plead, That the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> before the Rent grew due ſurrendred to him in Reverſion, and he accepted it, and <hi>Iſſue</hi> is upon the <hi>Acceptance;</hi> and at the Trial it is proved, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had executed a <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>Surrender</hi> (as in this Caſe) to him in Reverſion in his abſence; would not this turn the Proof upon the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> that he in Reverſion diſagreed to this Surrender? for ſurely his <hi>Agreement</hi> is <hi>prima facie</hi> preſumed, and then the Rule is, <hi>ſtabit praeſumptio donec probertur in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, I ſay it appears by the Caſes cited that it is not always pleaded, and when pleaded 'tis upon a ſpecial Reaſon, as I have ſhewn before, <hi>i. e.</hi> to conclude the party from diſagreeing; and it would be very hard to prove in Reaſon, that an <hi>Agreement</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting an expreſs <hi>Aſſent</hi> to be neceſſary) muſt be pleaded; for if it were a neceſſary Circumſtance to the <hi>Conveyance,</hi> why then 'tis
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51792:343"/>
imply'd in pleading <hi>ſurſum reddidit;</hi> for it cannot be a <hi>Surrender</hi> without it.</p>
                     <p>In pleading of a <hi>Feoffment</hi> it is enough to ſay <hi>Feoffavit,</hi> for that implies <hi>Livery;</hi> for it cannot be a <hi>Feoffment</hi> without it.</p>
                     <p>Now why ſhould not <hi>ſurſum reddidit</hi> imply all neceſſary requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, as well as <hi>Feoffavit?</hi> and therefore I do not ſee that any great Argument can be drawn from the Pleading. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is not always to be pleaded.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It cannot be made out to be neceſſary ſo to plead it; for if <hi>Aſſent</hi> be a neceſſary requiſite, then 'tis implied by ſaying <hi>ſurſum reddidit,</hi> as <hi>Livery</hi> is in <hi>Feoffavit;</hi> and then to add the words of <hi>Expreſs Conſent</hi> is as ſuperflous, as to ſhew <hi>Livery</hi> after ſaying <hi>Feoffavit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, If it were always neceſſary, it is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by an <hi>Aſſent</hi> intended in Law; for Preſumptions of Law ſtand as ſtrong till the contrary appears, as an expreſs Declaration of the party.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Memorand. Anno quarto Willielmi &amp; Mariae,</hi> this Caſe was brought by Writ of <hi>Error</hi> into the Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> and the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was there Reverſed upon the Reaſons in the aforegoing Argument.</p>

                     <p>IN an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs, quare Clauſum fregit,</hi> and digging up and carrying away of his <hi>Trees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appeared upon the Evidence, <hi>That the Defendant had entred into the Plaintiffs Cloſe, and digged up ſeveral Roots of his Trees, and removed them to a place on the ſame Ground, about two yards diſtance off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Queſtion was, Whether this were ſuch a Carrying away, as that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſhould have full <hi>Coſts,</hi> or only <hi>Coſts</hi> according to the late Statute, where the <hi>Damages</hi> are under <hi>40 s</hi> as was in this Caſe?</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleads in Bar, That after the <hi>Indenture</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and before the Action brought, another <hi>Indenture</hi> was made between the <hi>Defendant</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, of the one part, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> of the other part, which the <hi>Defendant ꝓfert hic in Cur'</hi> reciting the ſaid firſt <hi>Indenture;</hi> and further reciting, That the <hi>Defendant</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Sarah</hi> did then intend to Cohabit, and did at that time Cohabit, and expreſſing that it was the true intent and meaning of all the ſaid parties to the ſaid <hi>Indenture</hi> produced, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> by the <hi>Defendant,</hi> That ſo long as the <hi>Defendant</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould agree to Cohabit, the ſaid <hi>Annual</hi> payment ſhould ceaſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Defendant</hi> further ſaid, That he is, and at the time of the ſaid Election he was a <hi>Proteſtant Subject</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that he had not Received the <hi>Sacrament</hi> within a year before the ſaid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by reaſon whereof he was not capable to be Elected to the ſaid Office, and the Election, by reaſon of the ſaid Act, was void, <hi>&amp; hoc parat' eſt verificare, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>To this Plea the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Demurred.</p>

                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:51792:363"/>In the Argument of this Caſe, Sir <hi>John Read</hi>'s Caſe was Cited, who ſeveral years ſince was made <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> who was then under an <hi>Excommunication</hi> and ſo could not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and therefore after he had held the Office for three Months, left off, and did not attend at the <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> for which he was Fined <hi>500 l</hi> And after Argument in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> where it was inſiſted on, that the Act of <hi>25 Car. 2.</hi> made for <hi>preventing of Dangers that might ariſe from Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> did avoid the ſaid Office upon his not having taken the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do it by reaſon of his <hi>Excommunication;</hi> yet he was Adjudged in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Exechequer</hi> to pay the <hi>500 l</hi> Fine.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> held here, that the Matter pleaded by the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> was a good Bar; for in regard the Act of <hi>13 Car. 2.</hi> had Enacted; <hi>That none ſhould be Choſen who had not Received the Sacrament within One year before ſuch Choice;</hi> and there could be no Refuſal before the Election, it was plain that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had not incurred the Penalty of the <hi>By-Law.</hi> And it differed from the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Read;</hi> for he was once actually in the Office, and obliged thereupon to do all things neceſſary for his proceeding in it: But here, in this Caſe, to make a Default in the <hi>Defendant</hi> there muſt have been an Election antecedent, and the Election of ſuch an one as the <hi>Defendant</hi> is, is abſolutely prohibited by the Statute.</p>
                     <p>There were alſo two Exceptions taken to the <hi>Declaration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The By-Law is ſaid to have been, <hi>That if any Inhabitant ſhould be Choſen;</hi> whereas they cannot make By-Laws to bind all the Inhabitants of the Town, but only the <hi>Freemen</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Corporation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Vſage is ſet forth, That the Election ſhould be <hi>die Lunae proxime poſt Feſtum Sancti Michael' Archi',</hi> and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Defendant</hi> is alledged to be upon the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> but it was not ſhewn that it feſt upon the <hi>Monday,</hi> and that the <hi>Court</hi> can't take notice of it, or conſult the <hi>Almanack,</hi> as this Caſe is, where it ought to have been ſet forth in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Court</hi> held theſe Matters incurable, and ſo <hi>Judgment</hi> was given for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                     <p>And <hi>Judgment</hi> was given for the <hi>Plaintiff;</hi> for tho' the <hi>Money</hi> was awarded to be paid to <hi>William Dawney,</hi> and no mention of his <hi>Executors,</hi> yet the <hi>Money</hi> was to be paid to the <hi>Executors,</hi> for an <hi>Award</hi> creates a <hi>Duty.</hi>

diſtinctly pleaded, that he had nothing at the time of either of the Dimiſes, for the Declaration is of two Dimiſes, and the time being put in the ſingular number it cannot be carried to both, and tis not like pleading <hi>Non Aſſumpſit</hi> to a Declaration, containing ſeveral promiſes, <hi>vide Palmers Rep.</hi> A <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt a Corporation for ſeveral Franchiſes, and they pleaded a Preſcription to one, and a Charter as to another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>eo Warr.

                     <p>Now the <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Fountain of Juſtice,</hi> and that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as well as <hi>Civil,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Proxies Davis Rep. 4.</hi> It is ſaid the <hi>King</hi> has power, and that by the <hi>Antient Law</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> to Viſit, Reform and correct all Abuſes, and Enormities in the Iuriſdiction Spiritual; ſo that an Offence of this nature is a Violation of the <hi>Kings Juſtice,</hi> and a Tranſgreſſion of the Rules of his <hi>Adminiſtration.</hi>

                     <p>This is indeed the caſe of all Crimes of a publick nature, the <hi>King</hi> is moſt evidently injured by them; the <hi>Indictments</hi> run <hi>contra coronam &amp; dignitatem, &amp;c.</hi> Now, who ſhould have the Forfeiture, but he that hath the greateſt ſhare in the Injury.</p>
                     <p>Again, by giving of this Forfeiture to the <hi>King,</hi> the end and deſign of the Statute is like to be beſt anſwered, By the Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amble the Statute appeareth to be made, that worthy perſons might be advanced to places where Iuſtice was to be adminiſtred; and who is beſt to be entruſted with this but the King?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> having given theſe Reaſons, they came to conſider what had been inſiſted on at the <hi>Bar</hi> in the behalf of the <hi>Biſhop:</hi> It was ſaid, that all the <hi>Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical</hi> in the <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> was originally placed in the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the caſe of <hi>Gaſtrill and Jones, 2 Ro. Rep. 646, 647.</hi> was cited where it is ſaid, That the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51792:373"/>
Iudicial power of the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> was derived from the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> he is called <hi>Vicarius Epiſcopi, and Oculus Epiſcopi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tis true, there are ſome <hi>Archdeacons</hi> that have Iuriſdictions peculiar and exempt; but that is by Preſcription or Cuſtom; theſe are taken notice of by <hi>Godolphin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is nothing found of that in the <hi>Verdict,</hi> and ſo muſt be taken to be the common caſe of an <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> and that was agreed.</p>
                     <p>It was ſaid, this offence was reckoned <hi>Simony</hi> in the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> And the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had the correction of it, as in <hi>Smithes Caſe, Owens Rep. 87.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was compared to the Caſes of inferiour and ſubordinate Officers; which when they are forfeited, the ſuperiour takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as in the <hi>Earl of Pembrooks Caſe, and Sir H. Bickly, Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham 119.</hi> The <hi>Keeper</hi> of a <hi>Walke</hi> in a <hi>Foreſt</hi> forfeited, this went to him that had the cuſtody of the <hi>Foreſt;</hi> ſo in <hi>Bridgman's Rep. 27.</hi> He that hath Liberty of a <hi>Park</hi> in a <hi>Foreſt,</hi> when forfeited it goeth to the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Foreſt, 39 H. 6. 32.</hi> The <hi>Keeper</hi> of the <hi>Marſhalſey</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> forfeited his Office, the <hi>Duke of Norfolk Great Marſhal of England</hi> took advantage of it.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Caſes it was ſaid by the <hi>Court,</hi> That they differed much from the Caſe at the <hi>Bar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Caſes cited, the Inferior Officer is put in by the Superior, and in ſome Caſes to anſwer for his miſcarriage <hi>ubi reſpondeat Superior,</hi> they are Offices incident, as the <hi>County Clark</hi> to the <hi>Sheriff, Mittons Caſe, 4 Co.</hi> and <hi>Scroggs Caſe,</hi> of the <hi>Exigenter</hi> to the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas, Dyer 175.</hi> But here the <hi>Biſhop</hi> doth not put in the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the <hi>Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Court:</hi> He may make one to ſupply that place if it falls void, when the <hi>Archdeaconry</hi> is vacant, but then the next <hi>Archdeacon</hi> removeth him and puts in another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Forfeitures in the Caſes cited were upon Breaches of Conditions in <hi>Law</hi> annexed to the Offices; and tis a Rule in <hi>Law,</hi> that the Grantor is to take advantage of the Breach of all Conditions; but we are in caſe of a Forfeiture, for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt an <hi>Act of Parliament:</hi> And the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid, tho' it might be ſuppoſed originally, the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> within the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> was lodged in the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> yet the <hi>Archdeacons Court</hi> hath time out of mind been ſettled as a diſtinct <hi>Court, 4 Inſt. 339.</hi> and the Statute of <hi>24 H. 8. cap. 12.</hi> takes notice of the <hi>Conſiſtory Court,</hi> which is the <hi>Biſhops Court,</hi> and the <hi>Archdeacons Court</hi> from which there lies an Appeal to the <hi>Biſhops Court,</hi> in <hi>2 Ro. Rep. 150. Chivertons Caſe,</hi> The <hi>Archdeacon</hi> is ſaid to have a <hi>Court</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> take notice thereof: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s may be reſembled to the Caſe of the <hi>Torn</hi> and <hi>Leet</hi> in the <hi>County;</hi> the <hi>Leet</hi> is ſuppoſed to have been derived out of the <hi>Torn,</hi>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:51792:374"/>
and yet upon the Forfeiture of a <hi>Leet,</hi> it ſhall not go to the <hi>Sheriff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond Point it was reſolved by the <hi>Court,</hi> That the <hi>King</hi> might in this Caſe make a Regiſter before Office found. It was agreed, That where an Eſtate of Freehold was forfeited to the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that an <hi>Office</hi> would be requiſite to veſt it in the <hi>King,</hi> and that by the Statute of <hi>5 Edw. 6.</hi> againſt the ſale of <hi>Offices,</hi> all the <hi>Eſtate</hi> and <hi>Intereſt, &amp;c.</hi> of the Offender is forfeited. But <hi>Pollexfen Chief Juſtice</hi> conceived, this was not an <hi>Eſtate</hi> in the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> but only a Power to appoint a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,</hi> and in the nature of a <hi>choſe en Action,</hi> like the caſe of <hi>Offices</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> may grant or nominate to the <hi>Office,</hi> but hath not the <hi>Office</hi> in him to uſe or execute. But he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and with that the reſt of the <hi>Court</hi> agreed, that however as to the preſent vacancy the right to ſupply that was a Chattel ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Inheritance, and the <hi>King</hi> might ſupply the preſent avoidance before any <hi>Office</hi> found, tho' it be admitted, that the right of nomination in point of <hi>Eſtate</hi> ſhould not veſt in the <hi>King</hi> before <hi>Office</hi> found. Where the <hi>Kings Tenant</hi> dies ſeiſed of an <hi>Advowſon,</hi> or in caſe of an <hi>Outlawry,</hi> tho' the <hi>Eſtate</hi> is not in the <hi>King</hi> before <hi>Office;</hi> yet if the <hi>Church</hi> becomes void, the <hi>King</hi> ſhall preſent before <hi>Office, 20 Edw. 4. 11.</hi> The caſe ſo put of an <hi>Advowſon</hi> appendant, <hi>Stamf. Prerog. 54. B.</hi> Tis a Tranſitory Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, the preſent avoidance, <hi>Lanes Rep. 43, 64. 1 Ro. Rep. 326.</hi> and <hi>Jones Rep. 425.</hi> So the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Ward</hi> is in the <hi>King</hi> before <hi>Office.</hi> In Caſe of <hi>Simony</hi> the <hi>King</hi> ſhall preſent without <hi>Office, (Sed nota 31 Eliz.</hi> giveth the Preſentation <hi>pro hac vice</hi> only:) And the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Verdict</hi> found, that the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> had a <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> alſo; ſo that if nothing be in the <hi>King</hi> till <hi>Office,</hi> it muſt remain in the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> ſo his <hi>Grant</hi> will be good till <hi>Office</hi> found: There are no diſabling words in the Statute, but only ſhall <hi>Loſe and Forfeite,</hi> ſo <hi>quacunque via data,</hi> the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> ought to have Iudgment.</p>

                     <p>But then an Exception was taken to the Bar, that it was <hi>tempore dimiſſionum praedictar' nil habuit;</hi> whereas there are two <hi>Demiſes</hi> in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> might have a Title, the time when one was made and not the other, and <hi>tempore</hi> in the ſingular number can be underſtood but of one of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded, That the aforeſaid Paſſage belonging to the ſaid demiſed <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> is Scituate in the <hi>Pariſh</hi> of <hi>Saint James</hi> aforeſaid, and leads from the <hi>Houſes</hi> demiſed to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> as aforeſaid, to <hi>Six Bell Yard</hi> aforeſaid, and that a Drain to carry off the waſt <hi>Water</hi> from the ſaid <hi>Houſes,</hi> to the ſaid main <hi>Shore</hi> in <hi>Six Bell Yard,</hi> in and thorough the ſaid Paſſage might have béen,

and ſtill may be conveniently made; and that the <hi>Defendant</hi> did permit the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to make a Drain in and thorough the ſaid Paſſage, for the carrying off, &amp;c. and if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> would, he might have made it accordingly, but he refuſed to do it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Iudgment of the <hi>Action.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> Demurred.</p>
                     <p>And it was Argued at the Bar, that this Plea was inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for when the <hi>Defendant</hi> Covenanted, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſhould be permitted to make a Drain from the demiſed Premiſſes to <hi>Six-Bell-Yard,</hi> he was at election to make it through any part of the <hi>Defendants</hi> Ground that lay between, tho' the Ground were built upon, and ſo might be very inconvenient for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and tho' there might be another place to make the Drain in. And cited the Caſes of <hi>Election;</hi> as where a <hi>Feoffment</hi> is made of <hi>20</hi> Acres of ſuch a <hi>Wood, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Feoffee</hi> may take which <hi>20</hi> he will in any part of the <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> were rather inclined, that in this Covenant there ſhould not be Election to make the Drain through the parties Stables, or Buildings, in caſe there were other places proper and convenient to make the Drain in; for every Agreement muſt have ſome reaſonable Conſtruction that may be conſiſtent with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the parties. But no Opinion was delivered as to this Point, becauſe there were divers Exceptions taken to the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> ſome of which were fatal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no certain place laid for the Houſes demiſed, which are ſaid to be <hi>lying and being in the Pariſh aforeſaid;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are two named before, <hi>(viz.)</hi> St. <hi>Margarets</hi> and St. <hi>James's,</hi> ſo it was altogether uncertain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Breach is <hi>eo quod,</hi> they did not permit the <hi>Defendant;</hi> which is no poſitive Affirmation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Covenant is, <hi>That the Defendant, her Executors, Adminiſtrators and Aſſigns ſhall permit,</hi> and the Breach is laid in the <hi>Aſſignees</hi> not permitting; and it appears by the pleading, that this Aſſignment was made to <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> divers years before the Demiſe to the <hi>Plaintiff;</hi> and this Covenant cannot be extended only to the <hi>Aſſignees</hi> of the <hi>Defendant</hi> after the Demiſe made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here 'tis ſaid <hi>quod non permiſerunt;</hi> but no ſpecial Diſturbance, which ought to have been particularly ſet forth for the <hi>Court</hi> to judge of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> held all theſe Exceptions, but the ſecond, to be fatal, eſpecially for that the Diſturbance was laid to be by an <hi>Aſſignee</hi> which came in before the Demiſe; but as to the pleading the Breach <hi>eo quod,</hi> they rather inclined that it was good. And ſo the Opinion of the <hi>Court</hi> ſeemeth to be in the <hi>Cutlers and Southern's Caſe</hi> in the <hi>1 Sand. 116.</hi> But for the other Exceptions, <hi>Judgment</hi> was given againſt the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>

                     <p>But it was Reſolved by the <hi>Court</hi> in this Caſe, that the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry</hi> was a good Plea in Bar; for the Conſideration created a Debt, tho' that Debt was not reduced to a certain Sum. <hi>Markham</hi> and <hi>Pitt</hi> in <hi>3 Leon. 205.

                     <p>To this the <hi>Defendant Cramlington</hi> puts in a Plea in Bar to the effect as followeth; <hi>(viz.) Proteſtando,</hi> that there was no ſuch Cuſtom as ſet forth in the <hi>Declaration pro placito dicit,</hi> that long before the Action brought, <hi>Felix Calvert</hi> in the <hi>Declaration</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was one of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of <hi>Exciſe;</hi> and upon the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>November, Anno primo Domini Regis nunc,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Clever</hi> in the <hi>Declaration</hi> mentioned, did pay <hi>500 l</hi> of the Money ariſing to his Majeſty upon the Duty of <hi>Exciſe;</hi> and at the Requeſt of the ſaid <hi>Calvert,</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> upon the ſome <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> made and directed the aforeſaid <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exchange</hi> to the ſaid <hi>William Ryder,</hi> to pay to the ſaid <hi>Price 500 l</hi> for the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Calvert,</hi> as in the <hi>Declaration</hi> is ſet forth.</p>
                     <p>And he further ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Calvert,</hi> upon the <hi>24th</hi> day of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> was indebted to the <hi>King</hi> upon the Account aforeſaid in <hi>5000 l</hi> and upwards, <hi>prout per Recordum Scaccar' &amp;c. &amp; ſuperinde taliter proceſſum fuit in Cur' Scaccar' praedict';</hi> that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:51792:393"/>
upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> aforeſaid a Writ of <hi>Extendi facias</hi> was awarded to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>London</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Calvert</hi> for the ſaid Debt of <hi>5000 l</hi> commanding him to Enquire <hi>per Sacramentum proborum &amp; legalium hominum, &amp;c.</hi> what Goods, Chattels, Debts, Specialties, Sums of Money, &amp;c. the ſaid <hi>Calvert</hi> then had, and to extend and ſeiſe them into the Kings hands, in whole hands ſoever they then were, that the King might be thereout ſatisfied of the ſaid Debt <hi>juxta formam Statuti pro hujuſmodi deb' dicti domini Regis recuperand';</hi> Which Writ was Returnable the <hi>26th</hi> of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> and upon the <hi>24th</hi> was delivered to the then <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> who upon the <hi>25th</hi> day of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> by virtue of the ſaid Writ, took an Inquiſition <hi>per Sacramentum, &amp;c.</hi> by which it was found that the ſaid Defendant <hi>Cramlington,</hi> upon the <hi>24th</hi> of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> was indebted to the ſaid <hi>Calvert</hi> in <hi>500 l</hi> for Money received by him to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Calvert;</hi> and that the <hi>Defendant</hi> made a <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exchange,</hi> dated the <hi>10th</hi> of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> directed to the ſaid <hi>Ryder,</hi> to pay to the ſaid <hi>Price,</hi> to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Calvert</hi> the Sum of <hi>500 l</hi> and that the ſame was due to the ſaid <hi>Calvert</hi> at the time of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> taken; and that the ſaid <hi>Sheriffs</hi> did thereupon ſeiſe the Debt and Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change into the Kings hands <hi>ſecundum exigentiam brevis praedict',</hi> and Returned the ſaid Writ and Inquiſition, &amp;c. into the <hi>Exchequer prout per Recordum, &amp;c. plenius apparet;</hi> by virtue of which the <hi>King</hi> became lawfully entituled to the ſaid <hi>500 l</hi> and Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Defendant</hi> further ſaith, That afterwards <hi>(ſcilicet)</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>December, Anno primo, &amp;c.</hi> a Writ of <hi>Extendi facias</hi> was awarded out of the ſaid Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant Cramlington</hi> for the ſaid <hi>500 l</hi> and thereupon be paid the ſaid <hi>500 l</hi> upon the <hi>15th</hi> day of <hi>January Anno primo ſupradictio,</hi> to the uſe of the King in <hi>plena exoneratione &amp; ſatisfactione praedict' ult' mentionat' brevis de extendi fac' &amp; praedict' Billae excambij &amp; &amp; ſummae quingent' librarum per Inquiſitionem praed' ſic ut praefertur compertum, &amp;c.</hi> and concludes with <hi>Averments, (viz.)</hi> That he the Defendant <hi>Cramlington</hi> is the ſame ſo named with him in the <hi>Extent,</hi> and that the <hi>500 l</hi> the Bill of Exchange, &amp;c. in the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> found are the ſame with them mentioned in the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo demands Iudgment of the Action.</p>
                     <p>To this Plea the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Demurred.</p>
                     <p>And after divers Arguments <hi>Judgment</hi> was given in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> in <hi>Eaſter Term,</hi> in the firſt year of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now it came to be Argued upon a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:51792:394"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was alledged for <hi>Error,</hi> that the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is laid ſo general, <hi>(viz.)</hi> not only to extend to <hi>Merchants,</hi> but all others; ſo that it muſt be at the <hi>Common Law</hi> if to be allowed at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sed non allocatur:</hi> For in the Caſe of <hi>Sarsfield and Witherly,</hi> (lately Adjudged) it was Reſolved, That a perſon, not being a <hi>Merchant,</hi> drawing a Bill of Exchange, was bound according to the Vſage of it amongſt <hi>Merchants,</hi> and in <hi>Declarations</hi> upon Bills of Exchange, the whole Matter is to be ſet forth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There was (as appears by the Bill of Exchange) <hi>25</hi> Day given for the payment of it after the Date of the Bill; whereas here the Requeſt and Refuſal is upon the <hi>25th</hi> day after the Date.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sed non allocatur:</hi> For as the Bill is ſet forth, it is to pay the Money <hi>ad viginti &amp; quinque dies poſt datum;</hi> and this can't be, if not paid at the Five and twentieth day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Matter chiefly inſiſted upon for <hi>Error</hi> was, That the <hi>500 l</hi> was appointed to be paid to <hi>Price</hi> for the uſe of the <hi>Calvert,</hi> ſo the right and intereſt of the Money was in <hi>Calvert,</hi> by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhould be received, and then it might well be ſeiſed for the Debt which <hi>Calvert</hi> did owe to the <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> held, that the Seiſure for the <hi>King</hi> ought not to have been in this caſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For that tho' it were to be paid for <hi>Calvert</hi>'s uſe, yet this was but a Truſt, and the Right of the Money was in <hi>Price.</hi> As if Goods be given to <hi>A.</hi> to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> the property of the Goods is in <hi>A.</hi> Otherwiſe, if Money be delivered to <hi>A.</hi> to pay to <hi>B.</hi> there the Right of the Money is in <hi>B.</hi> and he may bring an Action of <hi>Debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Here the Bill is Endorſed over to be paid to the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> before any Seiſure, or the Writ of <hi>Extent</hi> was iſſued forth, and the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is expreſly laid, that an Endorſment might be as in the Caſe here; which Cuſtom is confeſſed, and that determines the Right and Intereſt in the Money of him that makes the Endorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puts it in the <hi>Plaintiffs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore the <hi>Judgment</hi> was affirmed.</p>

                     <p>They find, That <hi>Robert Durdant</hi> died on the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, 20 Car. 2.</hi> and that <hi>John Higden</hi> after in <hi>20 Car. 2.</hi> upon a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſideration in money, enfeoffed <hi>John Burchet</hi> of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes; and that the ſaid <hi>Burchet</hi> died the <hi>1ſt</hi> day of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame year, and that the Premiſſes from him came to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant Burchet,</hi> who entred into the Premiſſes and became ſeiſed <hi>prout lex poſtulat.</hi>

                     <p>Vpon his <hi>Special Verdict</hi> Iudgment was given in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Court</hi> here afterwards having heard the Caſe thrice Argued, did affirm the Iudgment.</p>
                     <p>And the firſt Point ſpoken to was, Whether the Eſtate did not execute in <hi>Robert Durdant</hi> by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> of <hi>Uſes?</hi> For if ſo, he would be ſeiſed of an Eſtate tail, and then <hi>Burchet</hi> would have a good Title.</p>
                     <p>It is clear, Lands may be Deviſed to the uſe of another, as in <hi>Popham 4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, a <hi>Deviſe</hi> implies a Conſideration, and will lodge the Eſtate in the <hi>Deviſee,</hi> if no Vſe be limited upon it.</p>
                     <p>Here it is Deviſed to <hi>John Higden</hi> and his Heirs, upon truſt and confidence that he ſhould permit and ſuffer, &amp;c. The word <hi>Truſt</hi> is proper for the Limitation of an <hi>Uſe,</hi> and the Eſtate ſhall Execute, unleſs it be firſt limited to the uſe of a man and his Heirs in Truſt for another, there the Intention is, that it ſhould be only a Truſt; and here <hi>Robert Durdant</hi> is reſtrained only from doing waſte, which ſhews, that he intended he ſhould take an Eſtate, or elſe he could not commit waſte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">But Lands may be Deviſed to an Uſe, tho' the Statute of <hi>Wills</hi> is ſince the Statute of <hi>Uſes,</hi> Mo. 107. 1 Cro. 343.</note>The <hi>Court</hi> over-ruled this Point, and Reſolved it to be only a Truſt in <hi>Robert Durdant;</hi> for the words are, That <hi>Higden ſhould permit him to take the profits,</hi> which ſhews that the Eſtate was to remain in <hi>Higden;</hi> And for the reſtraint of waſte it was proper; for <hi>Higden</hi> was to permit <hi>Robert Durdant</hi> to have the poſſeſſion, but the <hi>Teſtator</hi> would not have him to commit waſte or ſpoil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:51792:395"/>The ſecond and principal Point was, Whether the Remainder to the Heirs of <hi>Robert Durdant,</hi> now living, did veſt in <hi>George Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> or was a Contingent Remainder.</p>
                     <p>It was much urged, That one could not take in the Life of his <hi>Anceſtor</hi> by the name of <hi>Heir;</hi> for <hi>nemo eſt haeres viventis,</hi> in the <hi>1 Co. Archer's Caſe.</hi> A Deviſe to <hi>Robert,</hi> Remainder to the next heir Male of <hi>Robert,</hi> and to the heirs Males of the Body of that heir Male, this is Reſolved to be a <hi>Contingent Remainder</hi> during the Life of <hi>Robert;</hi> and it was ſaid in that Caſe, that the next heir Male is as much a deſignation of a perſon, as an Heir now living. He that will take by purchaſe by the name of Heir, muſt be a compleat <hi>Heir</hi> to all intents, <hi>Co. Littl. 24. b. 2 Leon 70. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner and Bowyer's Caſe</hi> upon a <hi>Deviſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it was Reſolved, that this was a Remainder veſted in <hi>George Durdant;</hi> for the Remainder being limited to the Heirs of the Body of <hi>Robert Durdant,</hi> now living, and <hi>George</hi> being found to be then the only Son, it was a ſufficient deſignation of the perſon, and as much as if it had been ſaid, <hi>to his Heir apparent;</hi> and ſuch an one is called <hi>Heir</hi> ſometimes in proceedings in Law, where the greateſt ſtrictneſs of phraſe is uſed; as in Writs of <hi>Raviſhment of Ward, Quare filium &amp; haeredem rapuit, 2 Inſt. 439. Weſtm. 2. cap. 35. 25 Ed. 3.</hi> the Statute of <hi>Treaſons,</hi> Treaſon to kill the <hi>Heir of the King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Point was, Whether <hi>George Durdant</hi> took an Eſtate Tail, or only an Eſtate for Life; for it was Objected, that if the words <hi>(Heirs of the Body)</hi> were taken for the deſcription only of the perſon who ſhould take, then he muſt take only for Life.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> held, that they would make an Eſtate Tail; for <hi>Heirs</hi> is <hi>nomen collectivum,</hi> and is ſometimes ſo taken when 'tis only <hi>Heir</hi> in the Singular Number. A Deviſe to one for life, Remainder to the heir Males of his Body for ever; this is an <hi>Eſtate Tail</hi> in the <hi>Deviſee, Pawſey and Lowther,</hi> in <hi>Rol. Abr. 2. Part 253.</hi> But in caſe the firſt words, <hi>(viz.) Heirs of the Body now living,</hi> would carry but an Eſtate for Life to <hi>George Durdant,</hi> yet the ſubſequent words would make an Entail in him, <hi>(viz.) and to ſuch other Heirs, Male and Female, as he ſhould hereafter happen to have of his Body,</hi> this would clearly veſt an Entail in <hi>George,</hi> he being Heir of the Body of <hi>Robert,</hi> and ſurviving <hi>Robert.</hi> So the <hi>Judgment</hi> was affirmed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sed Nota</hi> as to the ſecond Point, the <hi>Lord Chief Baron Atkyns</hi> and <hi>Juſtice Powell</hi> ſeemed to be an Opinion, that the Remainder was Contingent: But in regard the Point had been upon a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> brought in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> upon a <hi>Judgment</hi> given in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in another Caſe, upon the ſame <hi>Will,</hi> adjudged to be a Remainder veſted, they conceived themſelves bound by that <hi>Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords.</hi>

                     <p>That <hi>Patrick Harding,</hi> to the intent to Depoſe the King and Queen, and deprive them of their Royal Dignity, and reſtore the late King <hi>James</hi> to the Government of this Kingdom, did (for Money by the ſaid <hi>Patrick</hi> paid) liſt, hire, raiſe and procure Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen men.

                     <p>Vpon this <hi>Special Verdict</hi> found, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice, Juſtice Gregory</hi> and <hi>Juſtice Ventris,</hi> who were then preſent at the Seſſions, conceived ſome Doubt; for they were of Opinion, that it did not come within the Clauſe of the Statute of <hi>25 Ed. 3.</hi> of <hi>Levying War:</hi> For that Clauſe is, <hi>That if a man levy War againſt our Sovereign Lord the King <hi>in his Realm;</hi>
                        </hi> and by the Matter found in the <hi>Special Verdict</hi> it appears, that theſe Men were liſted and ſent beyond Sea to aid the French King.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo Doubted, whether it were a good <hi>Indictment</hi> within the Clauſe of the Statute of <hi>adhering to the King's Enemies,</hi> the Fact found in the <hi>Verdict</hi> comes fully within that Clauſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the ſending Men to aid the French King, then an Enemy to the King and Queen in open War againſt them. But the <hi>Indictment</hi> is ſhort as to this matter; for 'tis <hi>quod milites ſic ut praefertur levatos extra hoc regnum Angl' miſit ad ſeſe jungend' aliis hoſtibus inimicis &amp; rebellat' dict' Regis &amp; Regin';</hi> whereas it ſhould ſet have forth who the Enemies were, that the <hi>Court</hi> might take notice whether they were Enemies as the Law intends.<note place="margin">33 H. 6. 1. b.</note> If the <hi>Indictment</hi> had been <hi>That he ſent them to the French King, then in open War, &amp;c.</hi> it had been well.</p>

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51792:397"/>
deprive them of their Dignity, &amp;c. did for Money, hire, liſt, &amp;c. and an intent to Depoſe the King (proved by an Overt act) hath been always taken to be within the Clauſe of <hi>Compaſſing</hi> the <hi>Death of the King.</hi> So is <hi>Hales</hi>'s <hi>Pleas of the Crown, ſo. 11.</hi> and ſo it was held in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Time, and in the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Caſe in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> cited the Statute made <hi>29 H. 6. cap. 1.</hi> upon the Rebellion of <hi>Jack Cade;</hi> which Act ſets forth, that <hi>John Cade,</hi> naming himſelf <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> falſly and traiterouſly imagined the Death of the King, and the deſtruction and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Realm, in gathering together and levying of a great Number of the <hi>King</hi>'s People, and exciting them to Riſe againſt the King, &amp;c. againſt the Royal Crown and Dignity of the King; was an Overt act of imagining the Death of the King, and made and levied War falſly and trayterouſly againſt the King and his Highneſs, &amp;c. So that it appears by that Act, that it was the Iudgment of the Parliament, <hi>That gathering Men together, and exciting them to Riſe againſt the King, was an Overt Act of Imagining the Death of the King.

                     <p>It was ſaid on the other ſide for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> That the Caſe at Bar differed from the Caſes cited; for here the Intention of the <hi>Deed</hi> is to transfer the Eſtate to the Son, and that the Vſes ſhould ariſe out of ſuch Eſtate ſo transferred.

                  </p>
                  <p>Before I go any further, I will ſee what became of the Extents upon the ſeveral Statutes to <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Gerrard,</hi> after this <hi>Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Obſerve, that the <hi>Counſel</hi> for the <hi>Defendant</hi> hath Argued, That the Extents upon <hi>Gerrards</hi> and <hi>Elwaies</hi> Statutes were <hi>Reverſions</hi> or <hi>Reverſional Intereſts;</hi> and thereupon have concluded, that <hi>Knight</hi>'s Extent was drowned in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent, after they came both to be aſſigned to <hi>Edward Lewis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Point they made uſe of firſt, to remove <hi>Knight</hi>'s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute out of the way; for if that be not made an end of ſome way or other, there having been no Satisfaction acknowledged upon that, it would ſtand in way of the <hi>Defendants</hi> Title: And this is alſo of uſe to them in another Matter; for if the two Extents upon the Statutes of a latter date be <hi>Reverſional Intereſts,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence will be that when Sir <hi>John Lewis</hi> deviſed the Inheritance to <hi>Edward Lewis, Gerrard</hi>'s Extent will not thereupon be drowned in the Fee becauſe of the <hi>Reverſional Intereſt</hi> which was then in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> and <hi>Elwaies,</hi> that comes between; as is Reſolved in the Caſe of <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and <hi>Ewer</hi> in <hi>2 Brownl. 12.</hi> For if <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute were drowned by that Deviſe, it would make an end of it too ſoon for the <hi>Defendants</hi> purpoſe; for that the Eſtate and Intereſt by Extent they would ſuppoſe to continue at leaſt as to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:51792:402"/>
                     <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Elwaies,</hi> till ſuch time as Satisfaction ſhould be acknowledged, which was not done till Twelve years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I do not think it neceſſary to the Reſolution of the main Point of this Caſe, to inſiſt upon the Drowning; or to determine, whether the Extent upon <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Statute and <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Statute were <hi>Reverſions,</hi> or in the nature of <hi>Reverſional Intereſts;</hi> yet becauſe it has not been a Point much ſpoken to on both ſides, I will ſay ſomething to it by and by, and I do incline to think that they are in the nature of <hi>Reverſions,</hi> and that <hi>Knight</hi>'s Extent after the Aſſignment to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> became drowned in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent: But whether there were any drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or no, there is enough in the Caſe beſides to take <hi>Knight</hi>'s Extent out of the way, or to determine it: For I am not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute, as the <hi>Verdict</hi> is found, was ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at all; for it is found to have been acknowledged before the Mayor of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and that the Money was not paid at the day, and that <hi>Knight</hi> the <hi>Conuſee</hi> died; and that <hi>Iſaack Knight,</hi> his <hi>Executor,</hi> took a <hi>Capias</hi> thereupon out of the <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it being a <hi>Statute-Merchant,</hi> it ought firſt to have been certified into the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and from thence a <hi>Capias</hi> ſhould be iſſued out, Returnable in the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi> And ſo the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel (30 Ed. 3.)</hi> Enacts, and ſo is <hi>Fitz. N.B. 130.</hi> whereas here the <hi>Capias</hi> goes out of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and for ought appears was the firſt ſtep towards the execution of this Statute; for it doth not appear that it was ever certified, or that the <hi>Court</hi> had any Record before them to award this <hi>Capias</hi> upon, and ſo the Execution is quite in another manner than the Statute provides, and in a new Caſe introduced by the Statute, and therefore it ſeems to be void, and if ſo, then the Statute of <hi>Knight</hi> could not be aſſigned ſo as to paſs the Intereſt of it to <hi>Edward Lewis,</hi> and the Fines will have no effect upon it; and indeed it puts it clean out-of the Caſe before us, as if it had never been acknowledged, and the Intereſt of that Statute muſt be ſtill in the Executor of <hi>Knight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then admitting it to have been extended and conſequently well aſſigned, together with <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute, to <hi>Edward Lewis;</hi> if ſo, I take it to be drowned in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent. As to that the Caſe is no more than this; that after the Statute is extended there comes another Extent upon a <hi>puiſne</hi> Statute (for 'tis found that <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute was extended after <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute), whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Eſtate by Extent upon the <hi>puiſne</hi> Statute be in the nature of a Reverſional Intereſt; for if ſo, then when the Intereſt of the firſt Extent and the latter comes into one perſon, the firſt muſt be drowned; for an Eſtate for years, or other Chattel Intereſt, will
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51792:402"/>
merge in a Chattel in Reverſion that is immediately expectant. And that is <hi>Hughes and Robotham</hi>'s Caſe in the <hi>1 Cro. 302. pl. 32.</hi> If a Leaſe for years be made, and then the Reverſion is granted for years with Attornment, the Leſſee may ſurrender to the Grantee and the Term will drown in the Reverſion for years.</p>
                  <p>To which it is Objected, That an <hi>Extent</hi> is rather in the nature of a <hi>Charge</hi> upon the Land, than an <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Eſtate</hi> in the Land it ſelf. In the Caſe of <hi>Haydon and Vavaſor <hi>verſus</hi> Smith in Mo. 662.</hi> an <hi>Extent</hi> is thus deſcribed, that it is <hi>onus reale inhaerens gremio liberi tenementi &amp; tout temps Executory,</hi> as the words of that Book are, <hi>If the Tenant by an Extent purchaſe the Inheritance of part of the Lands extended, the whole falls,</hi> So a releaſe of the Debt will immediately determine the Extent; and it has been compared to one that enters into Lands by virtue of a power to hold until the arrear of Rent is ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>It is true, an <hi>Extent</hi> is an Execution given by the Statute Law, for the ſatisfaction of a Debt, and therefore the releaſe of the Debt muſt determine the Eſtate by Extent, becauſe the Foundation of it is removed; and ſo if the Inheritance of part of the Land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended comes to the <hi>Conuſee,</hi> it deſtroys the whole Extent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if a <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years purchaſeth the Reverſion of part, the Leaſe holds for the reſt: But in caſe of an Extent, if it ſhould be ſo, the <hi>Conuſee</hi> would hold the reſidue of the Land longer, becauſe the Profits that ſhould go in ſatisfaction of the Debt muſt be leſs, and this would be to the wrong of him in the Reverſion. But in other reſpects an <hi>Extent</hi> makes an Eſtate in the Land, and hath all the properties and Incidents of and to an Eſtate, and doth in no ſort reſemble ſuch an Intereſt as is only a Charge upon the Land.</p>
                  <p>An Intereſt by Extent is a new <hi>Species</hi> of an Eſtate introduced by Statute Law; Our Books ſay, that 'tis an Eſtate treated in imitation of a <hi>Freehold,</hi> and <hi>quaſi</hi> a <hi>Freehold;</hi> but no Book can be produced that ſays; that 'tis <hi>quaſi</hi> an <hi>Eſtate.</hi> The Statute of <hi>27 Ed. 3. cap. 9.</hi> Enacts, <hi>That he to whom the Debt is due; ſhall have an Eſtate of Freehold in the Lands;</hi> and the Statute of <hi>13 Ed. 1. de Morcatoribus</hi> ſay, <hi>That he ſhall have Seiſin of all the Lands and Tenements.</hi> When a Statute is extended, it turns the Eſtate of the <hi>Coniſor</hi> into a Reverſion; and ſo are the expreſs words in <hi>Co. 1 Inſt. 250. b.</hi> and ſo the Objection, <hi>That he does not hold by Fealty</hi> is anſwered, and there are no <hi>Tenures</hi> that are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but he that enters by virtue of a power to hold till ſatisfied an Arrear of Rent, he leaves the whole Eſtate in the Owner of the Land, and not a Reverſion only.</p>

                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:51792:403"/>If a Leaſe for years be made reſerving Rent, and then the <hi>Leſſor</hi> acknowledge a Statute, which is extended, the <hi>Coniſee</hi> after the Extent ſhall have an Action of <hi>Debt</hi> for the Rent, and diſtrain and avow for the Rent, (as in <hi>Bro. tit.

                  <p>And I take it, the conſequence of that is, That when an Eſtate by Extent is evicted by an Extent upon a <hi>prior</hi> Statute, as <hi>Elwaies</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> Extent was by the Extent of <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute; or where the <hi>prior</hi> Statute is firſt extended, and then a Statute of later date is extended, as <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute is found to be extended after the Extent upon <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute: In both theſe Caſes, the Extent upon the <hi>puiſne</hi> Statute will be in the nature of a Reverſional Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Reverſion</hi> is every where thus deſcribed, <hi>(viz.) An Eſtate to take effect in poſſeſſion after another Eſtate determined.</hi> 'Tis not in nature of a future Intereſt, as a Term for years limited, to commence after the end of a former Term; for ſuch an one ſhall not have the Rent upon a former Leaſe, as I have ſhewn before, but he that extends upon a <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years ſhall; for the <hi>Liberate</hi> gives a preſent Intereſt to hold <hi>ut liberum tenementum,</hi> but indeed cannot take effect in poſſeſſion by reaſon of a <hi>prior</hi> Extent, or by <hi>prior</hi> Title.</p>
                  <p>And this is the very caſe of a <hi>Reverſion</hi> which is an actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Intereſt, tho' it be to take effect in poſſeſſion after another Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Now I conceive it will plainly follow from this, That <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute is drowned in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute upon the aſſignment of both to <hi>Edward Lewis.</hi> 'Tis true in <hi>Fulwood</hi>'s Caſe in the <hi>4 Co.</hi> whereas in the Caſe before us two Eſtates by Extent were aſſigned to one perſon, there is no notice taken of the drowning, which makes nothing againſt it; for there was no occaſion there to ſtir or inſiſt upon that Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:51792:403"/>But the next thing to be conſidered is, (ſuppoſing <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute to have been well extended and not to be drowned in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute, after the aſſignment of both to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi>) how the Fine levied by <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> and <hi>Non claim</hi> will work to the barring of theſe extended Intereſts, that were thus in <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> at the time of the Fine levied?</p>
                  <p>That a Right to an Eſtate by Extent will be barred by a <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim,</hi> as well as the Intereſt or Right to a Term of years, or any other ſuch like Eſtate, cannot be queſtioned, and I think has been agreed of all hands. <hi>Saffin</hi>'s Caſe in the <hi>5 Co.</hi> and the Authority of a great many other Books makes that to be without Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Counſel</hi> for the <hi>Defendant</hi> have inſiſted upon two things in this Caſe, by which they have endeavoured to ſhew, that neither of theſe <hi>Extents</hi> ſhould be barred by this <hi>Fine;</hi> which I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and give ſome Anſwer to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It has been ſaid, that it is reaſonable to intend, That the Aſſignment of <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> was in Truſt, and to wait upon the Inheritance; and if ſo, the Fine by <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> ſhall only work upon the Inheritance. For it would be a great inconvenience when Eſtates for years, or by Extent, are taken in and aſſigned to protect Purchaſers from latter Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, if the <hi>Fine</hi> of him that has the Inheritance, and alſo the Truſts of thoſe Eſtates aſſigned, ſhould bar his own <hi>Truſtee.</hi> And tho in <hi>Iſeham</hi> and <hi>Morris</hi>'s Caſe, in the <hi>3 Cro. 109.</hi> there ſeems to be an Opinion, That a <hi>Truſtee</hi> in ſuch Caſe is Barred: Where the Caſe is:</p>
                  <p>That a man had purchaſed a Leaſe for years in Truſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and afterwards he bought the Inheritance, and afterwards ſold it, and levied a Fine to the Purchaſor; it is ſaid there, that Five years <hi>Non claim</hi> ſhall bar the <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the Term: For (ſaith the Book) <hi>the Truſt paſſed incluſively in the Fine.</hi> So that it muſt be underſtood in that Caſe, that the <hi>Coniſee,</hi> who was a Purchaſor, did not know of this Term, nor any Agreement to have it aſſigned in Truſt for him; and then if the <hi>Fine</hi> had not barred he had been cheated.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive the Law would have been otherwiſe, if by Agreement this Term had been to be aſſigned in Truſt for the <hi>Coniſee;</hi> and this I think goes upon a very good Reaſon; For he that has the Inheritance in Truſt, for whom ſuch a Term or Eſtate by Extent is aſſigned, muſt be taken as tenant at Will to his <hi>Truſtee,</hi> and then that his poſſeſſion is the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Truſtee;</hi> the conſequence of which is, That the <hi>Fine</hi> levied by him that has the Inheritance will work only upon that, when it appears that it was ſo intended, and that the Term ſhould be kept on Foot; whereas in <hi>Iſeham</hi> and <hi>Morris</hi>'s Caſe, for ought appears, there was no ſuch
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:51792:404"/>
Intention, not doth it appear that the <hi>Coniſee</hi> knew of the Term. So that I do agree, That if it were found that theſe Aſſignments to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> of the Statutes were in Truſt, and to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inheritance, which was after ſold and conveyed by the Fine of <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> to Sir <hi>John Lewis,</hi> that then the <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Non-claim</hi> will not work to the Barring of either of thoſe Statutes.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Special Verdict</hi> finds nothing of any <hi>Truſt,</hi> and we cannot intend it without finding; neither is there any thing found to induce or ground any ſuppoſition of a <hi>Truſt:</hi> For it is not found that either of the <hi>Aſſignments</hi> were made to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> for Money, or other Conſideration moving from <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> or Sir <hi>John Lewis,</hi> nor to have been made by any direction or a requeſt of theirs, and there was two years diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Aſſignments</hi> and the <hi>Fine</hi> levied and Sale of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes to Sir <hi>John Lewis,</hi> ſo that they cannot be taken to have been made with any relation to his purchaſe; and then it will be plain that <hi>Knight</hi>'s Extent (ſuppoſing it not to be drowned in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent) muſt be barred after Five years, without claim upon the <hi>Fine</hi> in <hi>1657.</hi> of <hi>Thomas Lewis.</hi> For as this <hi>Verdict</hi> is found, it muſt be taken that the Eſtate by Extent was diveſted and put to a Right; for the <hi>Liberate</hi> puts the <hi>Coniſee</hi> in actual poſſeſſion. If an Extent be made upon a <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years, the <hi>Leſſee</hi> after a <hi>Liberate</hi> to the <hi>Coniſee</hi> may plead an Eviction, and not before the <hi>Liberate, Hob. 82.</hi> The <hi>Coniſee</hi> after the <hi>Liberate</hi> is capable of a <hi>Releaſe</hi> to enlarge his Eſtate, <hi>1 Co. Inſt. 270. b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Verdict</hi> finds, that at the time of the Fine levied in <hi>1657. Thomas Lewis,</hi> the <hi>Conuſor</hi> of that Fine, was in actual and real poſſeſſion, and that <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> was in poſſeſſion <hi>prout lex poſtulat;</hi> this actual and real poſſeſſion in <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> could not be, unleſs he had regained the poſſeſſion after the <hi>Liberate</hi> upon the extent of <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute.</p>
                  <p>It has been Objected, That he ſhould be taken to have entred by the Conſent of <hi>Edward Lewis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no ſuch thing found, and ſo cannot be intended, and then that Eſtate by Extent muſt be diveſted; and ſo the Caſe is ſtronger than that of a Leſſee for years before Entry, who gains no actual poſſeſſion till Entry, and therefore his Intereſt cannot be properly ſaid to be diveſted; and yet a Fine will bar him, if he enters not within Five years. <hi>A fortiori</hi> a Tenant by Statute ſhall be barred, who has had the actual poſſeſſion by a <hi>Liberate,</hi> and then afterwards the <hi>Coniſor</hi> gains the actual and real poſſeſſion, as the <hi>Verdict</hi> expreſly finds, and levies a <hi>Fine</hi> upon the finding in this <hi>Verdict;</hi> which I take it to be as ſtrong a Caſe as can be put as to <hi>Edward Lewis,</hi> being barred by the Fine as to the <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:51792:404"/>Why then after that he became barred he ſhall have five years more to claim, in reſpect of <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute, this is ſtill upon a ſuppoſal that <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute was well extended, and that it did not drown in <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute: For if the Extent upon <hi>Knight</hi>'s Statute were void upon the Reaſons mentioned before, or if drowned, then muſt <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> claim within the firſt Five years after the Fine, to ſave <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent. For I ſhall grant that he may have Five years upon <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute, after the Five years <hi>Non-claim</hi> upon <hi>Knight</hi>'s Extent, and that by the ſecond ſaving of the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> for 'tis a new Right then firſt come to him upon <hi>Knight</hi>'s Extent, being barred.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I cannot agree with Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> and ſome that have Argued for the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> in the Writ, That if there be ſeveral Extents upon Statutes acknowleged at different times, that they are all preſent Rights, becauſe the <hi>Liberate</hi> delivers the Land to the <hi>Coniſee</hi> to hold immediately <hi>ut liberum tenementum;</hi> and therefore if a Fine be levied, he that hath the Extent upon the <hi>puiſne</hi> Statute muſt claim immediately, as well as he that hath the firſt Extent; whereas the Extent upon a latter Statute, until there comes an Extent upon an elder Statute, is either turned to a <hi>Reverſion,</hi> as I Argued before, or in the nature of a future Intereſt: And therefore till the firſt Extent be barred, or ſome way determined, he that hath the Extent upon the <hi>puiſne</hi> Statute, can have no preſent Right, and conſequently is not bound to claim, but his Right is preſerved by virtue of the ſecond ſaving of the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> But it appears by the <hi>Verdict,</hi> that above ten years paſſed after the Fine of <hi>Thomas Lewis,</hi> without any claim by <hi>Edward Lewis;</hi> ſo that I conceive he was barred as to both Extents.</p>
                  <p>So that which I have taken notice of to have already paſſed in the Caſe, is enough to bar the two Extents of <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and to let in the Right of the Extent of <hi>Elwaies</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs;</hi> ſo that I think they might have entred or made their claim without any thing more. But it is found further in the Caſe, that in the year <hi>1670.</hi> Sir <hi>John Lewis</hi> deviſed the Premiſſes by his Will in writing to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> and the Heirs of his Body, and for want of ſuch Iſſue to his two Daughters, who are married to the Earls the Leſſors of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and died in <hi>Auguſt 1671.</hi> and 'tis found that at the time of the Will, and alſo of the Death of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Lewis,</hi> the Lands were in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Edward Lewis;</hi> and in <hi>Michaelmaſs Term 1671. Edward Lewis</hi> levied a Fine of the Lands in queſtion to <hi>Francis Lewis,</hi> to the uſe of <hi>Edward</hi> (the <hi>Conuſor</hi>) and his Heirs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:51792:405"/>Now if we ſhould admit that the Extents of <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute were not barred by the Fine of <hi>Thomas Lewis,</hi> let us ſee what will become of them upon theſe things done ſince. And here I will agree with thoſe that have Argued for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> that the Deviſe of the Inheritance to <hi>Edward</hi> will not drown the Extent upon <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Statute. For, as I have Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued before, I take the Extent of <hi>Elwaies</hi> and <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, after the eviction by the elder Statute, to be turned to a Reverſional Intereſt, and then the interpoſing of the Reverſion will hinder the drowning of <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent in the Fee deviſed to <hi>Edward Lewis,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore let us ſee what is found to have been done further in the Caſe; and I conceive, if we ſhould grant as the <hi>Counſel</hi> for the <hi>Defendant</hi> have urged, That the Fine by <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> had no effect as to the barring of <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent, nor that the Deviſe of the Inheritance of the Premiſſes to <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> will not drown the Extent; as I agree it did not, by reaſon of the Extent interpoſing that was in <hi>Elwaies</hi> and <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Caſe, being (as I have Argued) a Reverſional Intereſt. I ſay, admitting all this, yet when <hi>Edward Lewis,</hi> who had the Extended Intereſts upon <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Statute in him, and the Eſtate of Inheritance alſo in <hi>Michalmaſs Term 1671.</hi> Levied the Fine to <hi>Francis Lewis,</hi> to the uſe of himſelf and his Heirs, that <hi>Fine</hi> muſt deſtroy and determine the Extended Intereſts that were in him. For where a Fine is levied by him that hath the <hi>Fee</hi> and <hi>Freehold</hi> in him, whatever Right, Eſtate or Intereſt there is in him beſides, paſſeth incluſively in the <hi>Fine;</hi> not by way of transferring the very Intereſt it ſelf, but (as it were) conſolidating with the <hi>Fee:</hi> So as to determine and extinguiſh ſuch Intereſt, none can pretend that after this Fine of <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> the Extended Intereſt did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in him.</p>
                  <p>They could not paſs to <hi>Francis Lewis,</hi> as aſſigned or transferred by the Fine; why then they muſt be deſtroyed: And I think it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Elwaies</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> might have entred immediately, the two former Extents being taken out of the way. And 'tis found that at the time of the Fine <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> was in poſſeſſion, ſo that Five years paſſing without Claim after the Fine (for 'tis found that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> was not acknowledged till Nine years after,) 'tis plain that the Extent upon <hi>Burroughs</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi> Statute was barred as to the preſent Right. For I think its clear, that when a former Statute is determined, whether it be by releaſe of the Debt, by purchaſe of part of the Lands, by being barred by <hi>Non-claim</hi> upon the Fine, <hi>Satisfaction</hi> acknowledged or any other means, this ſets in the <hi>puiſne</hi> Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:51792:405"/>And now we are come to the great Queſtion in the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Admitting the Extent upon <hi>Elwaies</hi> Statute was barred in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the preſent Right; Whether a new Rightcame upon the ſatisfaction acknowledged upon <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Sta-tute, ſo that there ſhould be Five years more given by the ſecond ſaving of the Statute of the <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> to claim upon that new Right?</p>
                  <p>It has been much urged by thoſe that Argued for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that wherever there is a Reverſion or an Eſtate to commence after the end of another Eſtate, that if a Fine be levied, tho' the Caſe be ſo that he in Reverſion may enter or bring his Action, ſo that Five years <hi>Non-claim</hi> will bar him as to the preſent Right or Remedy, yet he ſhall have Five years more to claim when the Time is incurred, or the Limitation come? That the firſt or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eſtate ſhould end.</p>
                  <p>Now, though the Extents upon the two firſt Statutes were ſo avoided, that there might have been an entry upon <hi>Elwaies</hi> Extent, yet the proper and natural determination of <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s Extent was not till ſatisfaction acknowledged upon Record, or by perception of Profits appearing upon Record, and then there ſhall be Five years given to claim, and that by virtue of the ſecond ſaving of the Statute of the <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> which is to this purpoſe, <hi>(Viz.) Saving to all perſons ſuch Right as firſt ſhall grow, remain, deſcend or come to them after the Fine levied, by reaſon of any matter before the Fine levied, ſo that they take their Action or purſue their Right within Five years next after ſuch Right ſhall come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I do not ſee that the Condition of this ſaving was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by thoſe that had the Right of <hi>Elwaies</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; the Right indeed came after the Fine levied, and upon a matter before; for it came after that the Extents upon <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Gerrards</hi> Statutes were barred, or otherwiſe avoided. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the <hi>Non claim</hi> by the firſt Fine, or their being deſtroyed by the ſecond Fine, which was levied by <hi>Edward Lewis;</hi> but there was no claim within Five years after either of thoſe Fines, ſo the Right clearly was not purſued within Five years after the Right firſt came.</p>
                  <p>And this has been held neceſſary to be done where there has been only a right of Action, as in <hi>Sawle</hi> and <hi>Clerke</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Jones 211.</hi> and <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> where the Caſe as to this Point is to this effect:</p>
                  <p>A Remainder upon an Eſtate Tail was diveſted by the Fine of Tenant in Tail, who had made an Eſtate for Life, warranted by the Statute, and died without Iſſue: He in the Remainder was barred from bringing a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the life of the Tenant for Life within Five years after the Fine, and had not a new Five years after the death of Tenant for Life, tho' he could not Enter in the life of the Tenant for Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:51792:406"/>And the Reaſon given in <hi>Crook</hi>'s <hi>Reports</hi> is, becauſe he had no other Right after the Death of the Tenant for Life than he had before; and this plainly diſtinguiſheth that and the Caſe at the Bar from the Caſes that have been cited of <hi>June and Smye</hi>'s Caſe in the <hi>1 Cro. 219.</hi> and <hi>Laund and Tucker 254.</hi> for there the Fine was Levied by the particular Tenant, which was a Forfeiture which he in Reverſion might chooſe whether he would take advantage of, and as the caſe might be, it would be to his prejudice to take advantage of it, where the particular Tenant has charged the Land; and therefore if he would, he ſhould have Five years after the Eſtate determined, to claim as of his Reverſion, which is another diſtinct Right from that of the Forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>And this was the ſtanding difference that made the diſtinction, where there ſhould be a new Five years given to him in Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion after the particular Eſtate determined, and where not; as we ſee in <hi>Margaret Podgers</hi> Caſe in the <hi>9 Co. 106.</hi> If the Tenant for years were ouſted, and a Fine levied by the <hi>Diſſeiſor,</hi> he in the Reverſion was bound by the firſt Five years <hi>Non-claim;</hi> becauſe, tho' he could not enter, as if the Eſtate for years had been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or as in the Caſes before of the Forfeiture; yet he might have immediately brought an <hi>Aſſize,</hi> with which <hi>Sawl</hi> and <hi>Clarke</hi>'s Caſe exactly agrees, and goes upon the ſame Reaſon. As for <hi>Freeman</hi>'s Caſe, the Reſolution goes wholly upon the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Fraud</hi> appearing in the Caſe; the principal of which was, <hi>That the Leſſee continued in poſſeſſion, and paid the Rent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs they have gone a little further of late; and now it is taken, That he in Reverſion ſhall have Five years after the Term is ended by effluction of Time, tho' there were no <hi>Forfeiture</hi> incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the Levying of the <hi>Fine:</hi> Nor no ſuch plain Circumſtances of <hi>Fraud,</hi> as appears in <hi>Fermer</hi>'s Caſe, and the Caſe put before, and cited out of <hi>Margaret Podgers</hi> Caſe is not held to be Law.</p>
                  <p>The contrary whereof is taken to have been Reſolved in <hi>Folley</hi> and <hi>Tancred</hi>'s Caſe in the <hi>24 Car. 2.</hi> and I do not intend to ſhake the Authority of that Caſe, but admit it to be good in Law; yet I crave leave to obſerve, That it is a Reſolution carried beyond the words of the Statute; for the Right is not purſued within Five years next after it firſt came. For it is agreed in <hi>Fermer</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>fo. 79.</hi> that there the Conſtruction was againſt the Letter of the Statute; and I muſt ſay, it is a Conſtruction by Equity, which is a little extraordinary to weaken the force of a Statute which was made for the quieting of mens Poſſeſſions, and to add force to Fines, which were of ſo great regard in Law; and eſpecially to make a Conſtruction by Equity, contrary to the Reaſon of the Common Law, which took no care of a future Right at all; for he in the Reverſion, in caſe of a <hi>Fine</hi> Levied at the Common Law, depended wholly upon the Entry or Claim of the particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:51792:406"/>
and in default of that loſt his Eſtate, as in the <hi>1 Inſt. 262. b.</hi> and in <hi>Plowden</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries</hi> in <hi>Stowell</hi>'s Caſe. I ſay again, I do not deſign by this to oppoſe any Caſe that hath been ſetled: But I confeſs I ſhould not have gone ſo far, if I had not been led by Authority; and am not willing to go a ſtep further.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall endeavor to ſhew, that this Caſe goes a great deal further, and would be a greater ſtrain upon the Statute than yet has been. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Obſerve, that upon all or moſt of the Caſes of a <hi>Fine,</hi> where there has been an Eſtate for Life or Years in being at the time of the Fine, that the Poſſeſſion has held ſtill in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tenant, ſo that he in Reverſion had no reaſon to ſuſpect any Fine or other thing done upon the Eſtate, there being no alteration of the Poſſeſſion. And this agrees ſomewhat with the Reaſon of the Common Law, in caſe of a Fine <hi>Executory;</hi> he that had Right was not bound to claim till there were an Execution of the <hi>Fine,</hi> and Tranſmutation of the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> thereupon, as in <hi>Plowden</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries 257. b.</hi> in <hi>Stowell</hi>'s Caſe: But here it is found, that the <hi>Conuſor,</hi> and not the <hi>Conuſees,</hi> or the Tenants by Extent, or either of them were in poſſeſſion; ſo that the Land being in the poſſeſſion of a Wrong-doer, they which had Right ought to have watched, and might well ſuſpect that <hi>Fines</hi> ſhould be Levied to the prejudice of their reſpective Rights. It is ſaid in <hi>Fermer</hi>'s Caſe, If a meer Wrong-doer having got the Poſſeſſion, levieth a <hi>Fine</hi> on purpoſe to bind the Right, this ſhall bind not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his unjuſt Deſign.</p>
                  <p>But the Differences that I chiefly rely upon, to diſtinguiſh the Caſe before us from the Caſes of <hi>Reverſions</hi> upon Eſtates for Life and Years, or the like particular Eſtates, are theſe:</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> That in thoſe Eſtates there is either, by an expreſs Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Parties, or an operation of Law, a certain and particular Term or End of the Eſtate, which until it happens, it has not its proper determination, which an Eſtate by Extent has not. I know it is has been much inſiſted on, that the natural and proper determination of an Extent is ſatisfaction by a perception of Profits, according to the extended Value; whereas I cannot ſee but a releaſe of the Debt, or ſatisfaction by a ſudden Accident, is as properly a determination of the <hi>Extent,</hi> as if it were run out by perception of Profits, according to the extended Value. For when the firſt Extent is out of the way the ſecond is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to take place; or why this acknowledging Satisfactoin on <hi>Record,</hi> ſhould be the natural and proper determination of the Extent more than a Releaſe of the Debt by the <hi>Conuſee,</hi> or deſtroying of it by a <hi>Fine,</hi> which is an higher Record than the <hi>Statute,</hi> or the Entry of Satisfaction acknowledged thereupon.</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> To let him that has the Reverſion upon an Eſtate by <hi>Extent</hi> have Five years to claim after the firſt <hi>Extent</hi> run out by percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Profits</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction</hi> acknowledged, is to let in a <hi>Claim</hi> after an Eſtate, that no man can ſee to the end of: For when it ſhall be ſatisfied by the Profits no man can tell, and can much leſs tell that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> will ever be acknowledged; whereas other particular Eſtates have a known and determinate Limitation, In the other Caſe it could not be computed within what compaſs of time a poſſeſſion ſhould be quieted, and ſo the Statute of <hi>Fines,</hi> in a great meaſure would be defeated of its end. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> and principally, It ſhould be in the power of the party that has the <hi>Extent</hi> in Reverſion, to protract the time as long as he pleaſed; for till he thinks fit to bring the <hi>Scire facias ad computan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> he nor no one elſe can ſay the <hi>Statute</hi> is ſatisfied. For that muſt appear by an account taken in the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> nor none can compel the acknowledging of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and ſo it ſhould be at the pleaſure of <hi>Strangers</hi> to him that is in poſſeſſion by a <hi>Fine</hi> to make his <hi>Eſtate</hi> liable to a future Claim as long as they pleaſed; and ſure this would render the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Fines</hi> of little or no effect. And this makes an Eſtate by <hi>Extent,</hi> to differ wholly from an Eſtate for Life or Years, or ſuch other like particular <hi>Eſtate,</hi> which will end of it ſelf, and cannot be protracted longer than the proper limitation of the act of any one whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with an Anſwer to an Objection, that has been much inſiſted upon by thoſe that Argued for the <hi>Defendant, That an Extent begins by Record, and cannot end but by Record, <hi>viz.</hi> either by an account taken upon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> or Satisfaction acknowledged upon the Record of the Statute; or at leaſt, he that is in Reverſion, is bound to take notice of any other determination of the Extent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, It begins by <hi>Record,</hi> but it may end without <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Record;</hi> for a Releaſe by the <hi>Conuſee</hi> after the <hi>Extent</hi> determines it to all intents and purpoſes; and undoubtedly in ſuch caſe he which hath a <hi>puiſne Statute</hi> may enter, an <hi>Extent</hi> upon an <hi>Elegit</hi> begins by <hi>Record;</hi> yet when ſatisfied by perception of <hi>Profits,</hi> he in Reverſion may enter: So that the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> as appears by our Books, is to be brought upon another Reaſon, and not becauſe the <hi>Extent</hi> cannot end but by <hi>Record,</hi> but 'tis becauſe of the incertainty of the <hi>Expences</hi> that muſt be ſatisfied. And why ſhould not they which have had the right of <hi>Burroughs</hi>'s Extent be bound to take notice of the <hi>Fines</hi> that have been levied, as much as the acknowledging of Satisfaction? And a <hi>Fine</hi> is much more a <hi>publick Record</hi> than the other, eſpecially ſince the <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>H. 7.</hi> has provided for the making of <hi>Proclamations</hi> upon it.</p>

                        <hi>A</hi> Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> was brought by <hi>Marſh,</hi> and an Anſwer put in thereto.</p>
                     <p>The Caſe was thus:</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Engliſh</hi> being ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Wickſall,</hi> and of the Mannor of <hi>Morfield,</hi> in <hi>1649.</hi> Mortgages part of the Mannor of <hi>Wickſall</hi> to <hi>Burrell</hi> for <hi>1000 l</hi> Afterwards in <hi>1655.</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a Statute to <hi>Burrell</hi> of <hi>800 l</hi> for the payment of <hi>400 l</hi> Afterwards in <hi>1662. Engliſh</hi> Mortgages both theſe Mannors to Mrs. <hi>Duppa</hi> for <hi>7000 l</hi> Afterwards in <hi>1665. Engliſh</hi> Mortgages the Mannor of <hi>Wickſall</hi> to <hi>Lee</hi> for <hi>2000 l Lee</hi> having no notice of the former Mortgages. But afterwards <hi>Lee</hi> coming to have notice of the Mortgage to <hi>Duppa,</hi> purchaſes in the two Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances to <hi>Burrel, (Viz.)</hi> the Mortgage of part of the Mannor of <hi>Wickſall,</hi> and the <hi>Statute.</hi> And now <hi>Marſh,</hi> Executor of <hi>Duppa,</hi> ſues <hi>Lee,</hi> who pleads this whole Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:51792:408"/>My Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> aſſiſted with <hi>Hale Chief Baron</hi> and <hi>Juſtice Rainsford,</hi> held, That <hi>Lee</hi> might make uſe of theſe Incumbrances to protect his own Mortgage. For they ſaid, that he had both Law and Equity for him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He had Law; for that he had a precedent Mortgage in <hi>164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> (which indeed was but upon part) and alſo the <hi>Statute</hi> in <hi>1655.</hi> ſo that while theſe remained in force, <hi>Marſh</hi> could not come in.</p>
                     <p>Next, He had Equity; for he having a ſubſequent Mortgage, <hi>(yet)</hi> it being without Notice, he ought to be relieved in this <hi>Court.</hi> And therefore my Lord <hi>Chief Baron</hi> put the Caſe, as if the firſt Mortgage had been of the Mannor of <hi>W.</hi> to <hi>Burrel,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it had been mortgaged to <hi>Duppa,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Lee,</hi> not having notice; if afterwards <hi>Lee</hi> bought in <hi>Burrel</hi>'s Mortgage, he ſhall hold the Eſtate againſt <hi>Duppa,</hi> until he be ſatisfied for both the Money which he paid <hi>Burrel</hi> and alſo his own Money lent upon the laſt Mortgage: And for that he ſaid, that it had been ſo Adjudged in <hi>Camera Scaccarij,</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Equity,</hi> ſince the King came in, in one <hi>Shelley</hi>'s Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Next he put the Caſe of the <hi>Statute</hi> which <hi>Engliſh</hi> entred in to <hi>Burrel</hi> in <hi>1655.</hi> and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bought by <hi>Lee</hi> from <hi>Burrel.</hi> He held that <hi>Duppa</hi> ſhall not bring <hi>Lee</hi> to any Account upon this <hi>Statute</hi> here in <hi>Equity,</hi> any otherwiſe than he may do at Common Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nota,</hi> It was agreed, that the Lands were extended upon the <hi>Statute</hi> at the third part of the true value. Now at Common Law the <hi>Conuſor,</hi> or he that claims under him, muſt bring a <hi>Scire facias ad computand',</hi> as in the <hi>4 Co. 69. b.</hi> But then the <hi>Conuſee</hi> ſhall not account according to the true value, but according to the extended value, and alſo for the whole <hi>Statute:</hi> And if the <hi>Conuſee</hi> is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the extended value the <hi>Conuſor</hi> ſhall recover; or if the <hi>Conuſor</hi> will pay down the reſt of the Money which is behind with Damages, he ſhall alſo recover. But if the <hi>Conuſor</hi> will ſue the <hi>Conuſee</hi> in a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Equity,</hi> then he ſhall bring him to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what he hath received of the Profits above the extended value.</p>
                     <p>Now then our Caſe here is ſomewhat more; for <hi>Lee</hi> has alſo Equity on his Side, and therefore <hi>Duppa</hi> ſhall not bring him to Account for what he has received above the extended value, unleſs he has alſo received enough to ſatisfie his own Mortgage of <hi>2000 l</hi> as well as the <hi>Statute;</hi> and therefore if <hi>Marſh</hi> will take off this <hi>Statute</hi> by a Suit in this <hi>Court,</hi> he muſt be content that <hi>Lee</hi> doth account upon the extended value for the whole <hi>800 l</hi> and Damages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:51792:408"/>Secondly, They held, that whereas part of the Mannor of <hi>W.</hi> was mortgaged to <hi>Burrel;</hi> but that now the whole Mannor was mortgaged to <hi>Lee,</hi> that <hi>(yet)</hi> the firſt Mortgage ſhould not extend to protect more than that part of the Mannor which was firſt mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>Burrell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And my Lord <hi>Chief Baron Hale</hi> put the Caſe thus: If a man is ſeiſed of <hi>60</hi> Acres, and mortgages <hi>20</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> and then mortgages the whole to <hi>B.</hi> and then mortgages the whole to <hi>C.</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>C.</hi> purchaſes in the firſt Mortgage, that ſhall not protect more than the <hi>20</hi> Acres; but it ſhall protect thoſe <hi>20</hi> Acres ſo as <hi>B.</hi> ſhall never recover that until he pay <hi>C.</hi> all the Money upon the firſt and laſt Mortgage.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid, That he thought that in this Caſe, inaſmuch as the Mortgage to <hi>Lee</hi> was only of part of <hi>W.</hi> that therefore <hi>Marſh</hi> might bring <hi>Lee</hi> to an Account upon the extended value, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon theſe two Mannors were extended upon the <hi>Statute;</hi> and if <hi>Lee</hi> had received the Money due upon the <hi>Statute</hi> by receiving of the Profits according to the extended value, or if ſhe will pay down the reſidue of the Money due upon the <hi>Statute,</hi> or if ſhe will pay down ſo much as the proportion will come to for <hi>Monfield,</hi> that then ſhe may diſcharge the Mannor of <hi>Monfield.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> asked him, how he would have it appointed, and how much ſhould be laid upon <hi>Monfield,</hi> and how much upon <hi>Wickſal;</hi> for that part of <hi>W.</hi> is under that Extent.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>Hale</hi> Anſwered, That if <hi>Marſh</hi> did ſue <hi>Lee</hi> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this <hi>Statute</hi> from <hi>Monfield,</hi> that <hi>Monfield</hi> ſhould be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by her paying down as much as the proportion comes to; or when <hi>Lee</hi> ſhall have received ſo much according to the extended value, and that he thought there might be a proportion found out by the <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>My <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> Declared, That he would not relieve <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages</hi> after <hi>20</hi> years; for that the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>21 Jac. cap. 16.</hi> did adjudge it reaſonable to limit the time of ones Entry to that number of years: Vnleſs there are ſuch particular Circumſtances as may vary the ordinary Caſe, as <hi>Infants, Feme Coverts, &amp;c.</hi> are provided for by the very <hi>Statute;</hi> tho' theſe Matters in Equity are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Courſe of the <hi>Court,</hi> and that 'tis beſt to ſquare the Rules of <hi>Equity,</hi> as near the Rules of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> as may be.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anne Hadly</hi> (now <hi>Pheaſant</hi>) one of the <hi>Defendants,</hi> being an Orphan of <hi>London,</hi> and having an Eſtate of <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4000 l</hi> in Money in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Orphans</hi> there, was married to <hi>W. Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> elder Brother to the <hi>Plaintiff. W. Pheaſant</hi> before he was at the Age of <hi>21</hi> years, and not having taken out this Money, dies, having bequeathed this Money <hi>inter alia</hi> to his ſaid Wife, provided that ſhe ſhould not claim <hi>Dower, &amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding ſhe brings <hi>Dower</hi> againſt the now <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> Brother and Heir to her late Husband. Whereupon he brings this Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> to make Diſcovery of this Eſtate, and to compel her to releaſe her <hi>Dower,</hi> or renounce this Deviſe; and thereupon obtains an <hi>Injunction,</hi> to ſtay Proceedings in the Writ of <hi>Dower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Point was, <hi>Whether this Money in the Court of Orphans were Deviſable, or no?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Serjeant Goodfellow</hi> Argued, That it was Deviſable as a <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel perſonal</hi> in the <hi>Teſtator</hi>'s poſſeſſion, and veſted in the <hi>Baron;</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Orphans</hi> have but have the <hi>Cuſtodiam, Co.

and a <hi>ſole Corporation</hi> to this purpoſe, ſo as to take Recognizance which ſhall go to his <hi>Executors,</hi> and is the only <hi>Corporation</hi> of that nature in <hi>England.</hi> His poſſeſſion is the <hi>Teſtator</hi>'s actual poſſeſſion, <hi>Latch 127.</hi> If the Servant be robbed, the Maſter ſhall have the Action, in the <hi>1 Cro. 37.</hi> This is not a <hi>Debitum,</hi> but a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> as in <hi>Cuſtodia in gremio legis</hi> by the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as if Money had been brought into <hi>Court</hi> here by a Compulſory Order, in which caſe it would have veſted in the Husband. Now in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Orphans</hi> they compel People to bring in the <hi>Money,</hi> or to give Security, and they pay no Intereſt, only allow <hi>Finding-Money,</hi> that is, for the <hi>Orphans</hi> Maintenance, and no more. Seeing the <hi>Feme</hi> is intituled to <hi>Dower</hi> immediately, it were hard that the <hi>Baron</hi> ſhould not have the Portion; <hi>Debts</hi> he ſhall not have becauſe of his <hi>Latches,</hi> in not bringing an Action whereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to Property; but this cannot be had until the Wives full Age. Vpon the Marriage of <hi>Orphans</hi> the Cuſtom is, to appoint the <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> to Treat and take Security for the <hi>Orphan.</hi>

                        <hi>Serjeant Maynard contra.</hi> This was a <hi>Choſe en Action, Debt</hi> lies for it, and it cannot be recovered without an Action. <hi>Intereſt</hi> is allowed for it according to the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> (tho' not <hi>Statute Intereſt</hi>) and proportionable to the Sum. And the Caſe of Dr. <hi>Ent <hi>verſus</hi> Adrian</hi> was, by the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> If a man dye leaving three Sons, his Eſtate ſhall be equally divided amongſt them; and if either of them dye within Age, his part ſhall ſurvive to the other. The Father taking notice of this <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> Deviſed, <hi>That if any of his Sons dye within Age, his part ſhould not ſurvive, but that it ſhould go to J.S.</hi> It was Reſolved, that the Father could not thus give the Childs Portion, becauſe but a poſſibility, and a thing not veſted in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wyld</hi> ſaid, That when he was <hi>Recorder</hi> he certified the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in that Caſe to be, <hi>That the Father might Deviſe.</hi>

                        <hi>Curia, viz Bridgman, Lord Keeper (Twiſden</hi> and <hi>Wyld</hi> aſſiſting) We are clear of Opinion, that this was a <hi>Choſe en Action</hi> and not Deviſable. A <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> lies not for it, if it be refuſed to be paid: It was the <hi>Latches</hi> of the Husband, that he did not recover it; for by the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> it is to be paid at the full Age or Marriage of the <hi>Female Orphan.</hi> The <hi>Chamberlain</hi> is not a Servant to the <hi>Orphan,</hi> but to the <hi>Mayor.</hi> If it were purely a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> it muſt be paid in <hi>ſpecie</hi> without Intereſt; but they pay <hi>Cuſtomary Intereſt:</hi> And tho' whilſt the <hi>Orphans</hi> are under Age (and Vnmarried, if Women) they give them <hi>Finding Money</hi> only; yet at the end of all, when the <hi>Orphan</hi> comes at full Age, (or if a <hi>Female</hi> marries) all is Caſt up, and the Intereſt is paid. The word <hi>Cuſtodia</hi> in Pleading imports an <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as in the Caſe of <hi>Guardian in Soccage, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Lord Mayor, &amp;c.</hi> have a Special

Intereſt in it, and if it be loſt or miſcarry, they are to Anſwer it. Let the <hi>Injuction</hi> be Diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nota,</hi> This Caſe was referred by my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> to <hi>Juſtice Wyld.</hi> A man opens a <hi>Mine</hi> in his Land, and digs until he comes under the Soil of another; whether he can follow his <hi>Mine</hi> there? And he certified his Opinion, that he might: But if the <hi>Owner</hi> dig there alſo, he conceived that he might then ſtop his farther progreſs.

                     <p>THe Caſe was thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>J.S.</hi> made his <hi>Will,</hi> (his Wife being at that time with Child) where he ordered that all his Perſonal Eſtate, after his <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Legacies</hi> paid, ſhould be laid out in Land (in caſe he had a Son) and be ſetled upon his Brother, for preſervation of his Name, and Deviſed, That if his Wife were delivered of a <hi>Daughter,</hi> that ſhe ſhould have <hi>3000 l</hi> paid her at her Day of Marriage, provided that ſhe married with her Mothers Conſent, and otherwiſe but <hi>1000 l</hi> and alſo Deviſed, That the Mother ſhould have <hi>80 l</hi> part of the Intereſt of the <hi>3000 l</hi> for the Education of the <hi>Daughter.</hi>

                     <p>Sir <hi>William Blois,</hi> who had Iſſue the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and two <hi>Daughters</hi> by a former <hi>Venter,</hi> and <hi>Jane</hi> the <hi>Defendant</hi> by a ſecond <hi>Venter;</hi> upon his ſecond Marriage ſetled Lands for the Ioynture of his Wife, and after her deceaſe (in caſe he had Iſſue only a <hi>Daughter</hi>) to raiſe <hi>3000 l</hi> for that <hi>Daughter,</hi> to be paid her at the Day of Marriage, ſo that ſhe married after <hi>Sixteen,</hi> or otherwiſe at the Age of <hi>Eighteen</hi> years; and if ſhe died before either, then his <hi>Heir</hi> to have the benefit.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards Sir <hi>William Blois</hi> by his <hi>Will</hi> deviſes the Reverſion of his ſetled Lands, and all his other Eſtate, to <hi>Jane</hi> his Relict, one of the <hi>Defendants,</hi> and three others; and ſays, <hi>That after the Son, by a convenient Match, ſhall have raiſed 9000 l for his three Daughters, that then they ſhould let the Son, the now Plaintiff, have his Eſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Queſtion now was, <hi>That if the Daughter by the ſecond Venter had 3000 l paid her, whether ſhe ſhould have any further benefit by the Settlement, and ſo take a double Portion, one upon the Will, and another upon the Settlement?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Decree</hi> made by my <hi>Lord Fynch</hi> was, That if the <hi>Heir</hi> paid <hi>9000 l</hi> the Security by the Settlement ſhould be diſcharged, the <hi>Will</hi> being but Cumulative Security, and ſo the <hi>Defendant Jane</hi> was to have but one <hi>3000 l</hi> and be ſubject to the ſame Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies with the Settlement, and gave the <hi>Heir</hi> two years time to pay the Money; and in the mean time <hi>Jane</hi> to have a third part of the Profits of the Land deviſed.</p>

                        <pb n="348" facs="tcp:51792:413"/>My <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> cited one <hi>Pyne</hi>'s Caſe; where a man had ſecured Portions for his Children, and afterwards by his <hi>Will</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to each of them a like Sum; it was held, that this would not double their Portions; unleſs plainly proved that he intended to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nota,</hi> If one ſue in <hi>Chancery</hi> an <hi>Executor</hi> of one <hi>Obligor,</hi> to diſcover <hi>Aſſets,</hi> you muſt make all the <hi>Obligors</hi> parties, that the Charge may lye equal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether you may not ſue the <hi>Principal,</hi> and leave out them that are bound only as Sureties?

                     <p>That their Grandfather was ſeiſed in Fee, and made a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he entailed the Eſtate; but with a power of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by any Writing publiſhed under his Hand and Seal in the preſence of three <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Caſe was; That he made his <hi>Will</hi> under his Hand and Seal, wherein he recited his Power, and declared that he Revoked the <hi>Settlement;</hi> but the <hi>Will</hi> had but two <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which ſubſcribed their Names, tho' a third preſent, and died.

                     <p>The <hi>Decree</hi> was that the <hi>Mortgage Money</hi> ſhould be paid.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, My <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> ſaid, that here was an Execution of the Power in ſtrictneſs, tho' the third Witneſs did not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If there had not, that <hi>Equity</hi> ſhould help it in ſuch a little Circumſtance where the Owner of the Eſtate had fully declared his Intention. There is a difference where a man has power to make <hi>Leaſes, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhall charge and incumber a third perſons Eſtate, ſuch <hi>Powers</hi> are to have a rigid Conſtruction; but where the <hi>Power</hi> is to diſpoſe of a mans own Eſtate, it is to have all the favour imaginable.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>WEST,</hi> Heir apparent of the <hi>Lord Delaware,</hi> Exhibited his Bill againſt the ſaid Lord, ſetting forth:</p>
                     <p>That upon a Marriage agreed to be had between him and the Daughter of one <hi>Mr. Huddleſton,</hi> with whom he was to have <hi>10000 l</hi> Portion. The Lord his Father Articled to ſettle Lands of ſuch yearly value for the Wives Ioynture, for their maintenance and the Heirs of their Bodies, &amp;c. That the Wife being now dead (and without Iſſue) and no Settlement made, the <hi>Bill</hi> prayed an Execution of the <hi>Articles,</hi> and a diſcovery of what Incumbrances there were upon the Lands to be ſetled.</p>
                     <p>To this the <hi>Lord Delaware</hi> Anſwered, That he never intended to ſettle Lands, but for the Wives Ioynture only, and that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> her Husband was not named in the <hi>Articles,</hi> and ſo was Adviſed, <hi>He need make no Settlement;</hi> and upon that Reaſon the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> could not require him to diſcover Incumbrances.</p>
                     <p>An Exception being taken to the Anſwer, for that it did not diſcover any thing touching Incumbrances, it was Argued before my Lord; and for the <hi>Defendant</hi> it was alledged, That by the Courſe of the <hi>Court</hi> the time of the Diſcovery ſhould be when the other Point was determined; for if that be for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> then no Diſcovery can be required; but if otherwiſe, that then the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhall be put to anſwer <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> as is uſual in Caſes of like nature: And it cannot be Objected. <hi>That the Eſtate may be charged with Incumbrances ſince the Bill, becauſe they will be of no avail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other ſide it was ſaid, That this would create great delay; for upon the diſcovery of <hi>Incumbrances</hi> other parties muſt be made to the Bill, and therefore this Caſe differed from the Caſe of <hi>Account,</hi> which concerns the <hi>Defendant</hi> himſelf only; but the Queſtion now is only for the making proper Parties.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> Ordered, That a further <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſhould be made.</p>

                     <p>The Cauſe came to Hearing, and the <hi>Court</hi> Decreed for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For altho' a <hi>Legatee</hi> ſhall refund againſt <hi>Creditors</hi> (if there be not <hi>Aſſets</hi>) and againſt <hi>Legatees,</hi> all which are to have theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion where the <hi>Aſſets</hi> fall ſhort; yet the Executor himſelf, after his Aſſent, ſhall never bring the Legacy back: But if he had been ſued and paid it by the Decree of this <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Legatee</hi> muſt have refunded; as if a Debtor to a Bankrupt pays him voluntarily, he muſt pay him over again. Otherwiſe of payment by Compulſion of Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> My <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> ſaid, That if they give Sentence for a Legacy in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> a <hi>Prohibition</hi> lies, unleſs they take Security to Refund.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>It was Objected, <hi>That this could not be taken for an Aſſent; for if ſo, how could the Executor let it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid, that it did <hi>tantamount</hi> to an Aſſent, and being a lawful Act a little matter will be taken for an Aſſent.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in the Life of his Father, being about <hi>26</hi> years of Age, and having occaſion for Money, prevails with the <hi>Defendant</hi> to let him have in <hi>Wares</hi> to the value of <hi>400 l</hi> and gives him Bond for <hi>800 l</hi> to be paid if he ſurvived his Father (at which time an Eſtate would befall him of <hi>5000 l per Annum;)</hi> and he having ſurvived his Father, he preferred his <hi>Bill</hi> againſt the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> to compel him to take his Principal Money and Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>And it was proved in the Caſe, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the time of this bargain, that the Father was ill, and not like to live, (and he did live but a year and half after) and that one <hi>Stiſted,</hi> a man very Infamous, was employed in the tranſaction of this Bargain.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> obtained a <hi>Decree</hi> in the time of the <hi>Lord Chancellor Fynch.</hi>

                     <p>And now upon a Petition to the <hi>Lord Keeper North</hi> the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> obtained a Re-hearing.</p>

                     <p>After which, upon the Account againſt the Son, it appeared that the firſt Executor had waſted the Goods of the firſt Teſtator to ſuch a value.</p>
                     <p>And then the party, at whoſe Suit the ſaid Account was, and who was to have the benefit thereof, together with the Son and Executor of the firſt Executor, preferred a <hi>Bill</hi> againſt the Legatee of the Goods, to make him Refund, and obtained no Relief; eſpecially for that he had made the Executor <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> who ſhould not be admitted to undo his own Aſſent.</p>
                     <p>But liberty being given to bring a New Bill againſt the Legatee and the ſaid Executor, the Cauſe came to Hearing, and it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, That the Legatee ſhould Refund: So that one Legatee that is paid, ſhall not only Refund againſt another; but a Legatee ſhall Refund againſt a Creditor of the Teſtator, that can charge an Executor only in Equity, <hi>(viz.)

                     <p>It was agreed on all hands, that if this had been a <hi>Legacy,</hi> or a Sum of Mony bequeathed by the <hi>Will,</hi> altho' the party had died before the Age of <hi>21</hi> or Marriage, the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> ſhould have had it; and that is the Practice in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court</hi> in caſe of <hi>Legacies.</hi> The <hi>Legatee</hi> in ſuch caſe is taken to have a preſent Intereſt, tho' the time of payment be future.</p>

                        <hi>William Whitmore</hi> the Son made his Will in Writing; and thereby Deviſed to <hi>Frances</hi> his Wife all his Eſtate real and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and makes her ſole <hi>Executrix,</hi> and about the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> died without Iſſue, being above the Age of <hi>18</hi> years, and under the Age of <hi>21</hi> years, not having proved his Father's Will.</p>
                     <p>The Will of <hi>William Whitmore</hi> the elder, is duly proved by <hi>Frances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Queſtion was, <hi>Whether <hi>Frances Whitmore</hi> the Executrix of <hi>William Whitmore</hi> the Son, be well Entituled to the ſurpluſage of the Perſonal Eſtate of <hi>William Whitmore</hi> the Father, or the Diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the Siſters?</hi>

                     <p>And afterwards by Order it came to be heard before the <hi>Lord Chancellor Jefferies,</hi> who upon Hearing of the <hi>Counſel</hi> of both ſides, Decreed it for <hi>Frances Whitmore</hi> the Complainant; for that the Executorſhip of my <hi>Lord Craven</hi> determined at the Age of <hi>17</hi> years of <hi>William Whitmore</hi> the Son, and then the Surpluſage became an Intereſt veſted in him, and could not be deviſed over: And his Lordſhip ſeemed to be of Opinion, <hi>That Minority in the Clauſe wherein the Deviſe over was, ſhould be underſtood to determine at the ſame time, as in the Clauſe of Executorſhip.</hi>
